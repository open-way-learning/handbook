# The collaborative culture we model in our work

## Expectations for collaboration
OWL's working philosophy (that everyone can contribute, regardless of title, tenure with the organization, etc.) means that everyone on our team is empowered to bring our mission and vision to life by making a positive, value-adding impact with everything they do. Every day.

We are able to effectively model this approach because our team brings a vast and diverse array of experience (in and out of education) to the table. As such, no one should feel that they don't have to have the required degree, certification, minimum service time, or specific role that makes them less of a contributor to the important work OWL does or to the tools we use.

This open, radically collaborative, collective leadership approach works because we're a team of passionate people who want to help each other, our nonprofit, and the educators we network with in the broader OWL community succeed. We learn from each other, challenge each other, and thank each other. The minimum that’s asked of you in such a collaborative culture is to come to the work everyday prepared to do whatever it takes to help shape the future of the organization as we strive to live our mission and vision!

## Collaboration and document handling guidelines
Our commitment to openness, transparency, and learner-centered innovation extends to how we collaborate with external partners, including whenever we work together on collaborative documents and platforms (e.g. Google Docs, Mural, Padlet, emails, etc.). This policy ensures that employees engage in professional collaboration that uses clear, concise, and respectful language while also safeguarding sensitive information that upholds OWL's reputation and positive working relationships.

The internal treatment of confidential information is thoroughly addressed in OWL’s [Code of Conduct and Ethics](/our-policies/code-of-conduct-and-ethics.md). Most other documentation we produce should be assumed to be sharable outside the organization. This is both to honor our deep commitment to being an open organization and to provide a solid safeguard to ensure the documentation we produce can undergo public scrutiny—something that should always be assumed to be the case for any communication or documentation produced in collaboration with any public school. 

Nevertheless, there may be times when documentation is intended to be internal or for private use. In these cases, it is important to ensure safeguards are maintained so that such documents are not shared beyond the organization (e.g. setting the sharing settings to only Open Way Learning employees) and only then via a need-to-know basis. Even in these situations, however, one should always take care to document facts over opinions, avoid any language that would be perceived as being disrespectful or harmful, and never to document anything that could potentially damage the reputation of OWL or our working relationship with partners.

A good rule of thumb, even with private notes (electronic or hardcopy), is to assume that someone outside of the organization will eventually read it. In other words, while managing documentation is important, the most important thing is to never engage in any communication, even private, that could potentially undermine the mission of the organization.
