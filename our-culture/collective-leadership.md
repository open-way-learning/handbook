# OWL's collective leadership
In addition to radical collaboration, OWL fully embraces a collective leadership model for how we manage our work and each other - it is the way that everyone can contribute by making mission-aligned decisions on a daily basis in everything they do. 

OWL's collective leadership model differentiates itself from other management philosophies by consciously enabling decentralized decision making across the entire organization (thus creating a centralized organizational ethos of collective autonomy). While guiding principles exist in the form of the OWL mission, vision, core values, and annual strategic goals, the approach is not static. It is designed for reflection, iteration, and evolution by everyone - again, the impetus for the detail included in this Handbook.

By implementing OWL's collective leadership approach at an organizational level, individuals within the organization are less constrained and more empowered. Each team member receives greater agency to exert self-leadership. Collectively, we believe this atmosphere allows for more informed decisions, made quicker, more frequently, and with a higher likelihood of successful execution. The key pillars of this collective leadership philosophy include the following.

### Informed decisions
While other management philosophies prioritize the speed of knowledge transfer, OWL's collective leadership approach optimizes for the speed of knowledge retrieval. As such, the key question answered is no longer, "How does the organization quickly get information to the right people at the right time?", but rather, "How does the organization create a system where everyone can find the information they need to quickly and competently contribute, regardless of role?‚Äù This handbook is the primary hub and conduit for such information.

### Many decisions
Conventional management philosophies often strive for consensus and avoid risk instead of a bias for action, resulting in less frequent and more cumbersome decision making. When you're operating in a collective leadership mindset, success is measured by the quantity of informed, empowered decisions made in a particular stretch of time, as well as the results that stem from faster progress toward our common goals, mission, and vision (i.e. higher quality from better decisions).

### Executing on decisions
Being more informed, making faster decisions, and increasing quality decisions is only useful if you execute. Collective leadership also means that everyone is empowered to autonomously contribute through successful execution of decisions relative to how their role aligns to OWL's strategic goals and its mission and vision. It also recognizes that execution is not a one-time event; rather, it is the establishing of a new baseline on which we reflect so that future iterations are applied and we continuously improve (think continuous beta).

### Trust
Trust is not only a prerequisite for OWL's collective leadership approach, it is an underlying assumption in everything we do. "Open" in Open Way Learning is based on a model of transparency and trust. Therefore we invest time and energy to build relationships, build individual and collective capacity, and then trust each other to make good, mission-driven decisions, but also to ask questions in cases where we need more information, and to own decisions that could have been better.
