# Startup mindset
Many companies, including nonprofits, regress to being slow, impersonal, and bureaucratic over time as they grow and lose touch with their startup roots. While some changes are required as any entity matures, not all change is inevitable or should be allowed to passively happen. As OWL grows, we are conscious of how we operate and how a "startup mentality" enables us to continue to operate with the agility of a startup, while realizing the efficiencies of a scaling company (reference Kotterâ€™s Dual Operating System). This approach is key to efficiency, enables iteration, and helps us to drive results. It also helps us to see progress as we grow our client base while not eroding the high quality of service we provide.

In order to operate like a startup, we ask every team member to find ways to reinforce the startup ethos within the organization and then bring those ideas forward (note that as mentioned at the beginning of this document, this is the rationale behind an information-rich Employee Handbook. It provides guidelines, not rules, for how team members should operate.

And because you are empowered to suggest changes, it also ensures that information is easily shared, consistent, and accessible. 

A few examples of how we maintain this startup mindset include:

* Proactively recruiting and hiring team members who demonstrate an ability to excel in an open, flat organization that relies on collective leadership. 
* Providing a competitive compensation package and work environment that enables everyone to contribute with purpose, mastery, and autonomy.
* Always striving to be true to OWL's mission, vision, and values in everything we do, even if it means walking away from lucrative contracts.
* Committing to the open source ethos, including knowledge sharing that involves being transparent to and beyond our employees and stakeholders.
* Expecting every employee to always feel empowered to understand the why behind what they are being asked to do. If they don't, they should ask for context, so they can make fast progress toward understood goals.
* Always exploring new ways to remove constraints and bureaucracy!
