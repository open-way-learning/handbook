# Managing conflicts
Conflict in the workplace is inevitable when you have employees of various backgrounds and different work styles, even if they are all working towards the same goals, mission, and vision. Nevertheless, conflict should never just be avoided \- it should be managed and resolved, and the earlier this is done, the better. 

Conflict is any situation in which your concerns, desires, perceptions, goals or values differ and clash with other employees. Potential causes of workplace conflict include, but are not limited to personality differences, employee behavior that is regarded by some as irritating or annoying, perceived unfairness or inequities of resources, unclear role expectations, poor communication skills, differences over work methods or goals, and employees simply having a bad day. Unaddressed conflict can lead to diminished productivity, workplace tension, low morale, inappropriate behavior, absenteeism, and even more difficult conflict.

The first step is for the employees that experience conflict is to recognize it and then work to address the situation towards a workable resolution. If a resolution is not possible, a manager or mediator should be asked to independently and objectively work with the employees to help foster a satisfactory resolution.

Employees should be expected to be able to support their positions with data. This will take the conflict from emotional to rational.

Here are the different methods for managing conflict the OWL encourages all employees to use. These approaches are ordered in terms of relative difficulty (easiest to most difficult) and where possible, employees should strive for the method as close to the collaboration as possible and where practical:

1. **Competing**: Managing conflict through unilateral decision making. This method is used in situations that require a quick decision, instances where there is no compromise or debate on making a hard decision. Example: "Sorry X, but that's my decision as your manager."
2. **Avoidance:** Actively deciding not to manage a conflict. This method is used for unimportant, non-work related issues, when buying time until a resolution can be reached, or recognizing issues as symptoms to a larger problem. Examples: "This doesn't seem to be a good time to discuss this issue with X" or "Maybe. We'll see. Let's move along to the next topic."
3. **Accommodation:** Allowing the other side to "win." This method is used when making active decisions on what can be "let go" in order to maintain peace and create goodwill. Examples: " I can see this is important to you, OK." or “I didn't think of that, you are right." or "You are the experts, I'll trust your judgement."
4. **Compromise:** Reaching a “win-win” resolution. This method is used for resolving issues of moderate to high importance by finding a solution that involves equal power and a strong commitment on both sides. It is also useful in situations where a temporary "fix" may have been made via the competing or collaborating methods. Examples: "Suppose I do X this time and then you do Y next time" or "You think X will solve the problem but I think Y will, so perhaps we say X and Y are possible solutions?"
5. **Collaboration:** Managing conflict through team input. This method is the preferred approach in most, but not all, situations. It seeks to gain support from the team, using different perspectives as an opportunity to learn and improve relationships through active listening and collaboration. In many cases it is done via a [facilitated protocol](https://www.nsrfharmony.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DilemmaConsultancy_0.pdf). Examples: "You need to fund project X but I need to project Y, how can we do both?" or "You are praising X's technical skills, however I have concerns about their iteration and collaboration skills. Both are true aren't they? They have high potential if they can improve on their interpersonal skills."
