description: Open Way Learning's commitment to equity
---

Open Way Learning stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and with every organization that is fighting for racial equity and justice. The work that Open Way Learning does to create cultures of localized, authentic innovation is grounded in an explicit goal to close the unacceptable equity gap, enable more authentic culturally responsive learning environments, and ultimately dismantle systems of institutional racism and oppression that have existed for far too long within our schools and the education space in general. 

Words are not enough, however, and so the work we do is aimed at explicitly modeling how to help enable the disruption of systems that directly or indirectly perpetuate inequality and injustice, especially for students who have historically been the furthest from opportunity. 

To be clear, if the type of authentic innovation we advocate for is only occurring in better resourced schools, attended by historically privileged students, then we will only exacerbate the already unacceptable equity gap. That cannot occur! 

This is why we strive to quicken the pace of positive change for low income students, students of color, indigenous populations, and others who have historically been underserved by the traditional school model.

We not only welcome, but expect that all employees will join us to affect the kind of institutional change needed to dismantle inequitable structures sustained and perpetuated by the traditional school model to bring more equitable solutions for every student, regardless of school system, income, zip code, or background.
