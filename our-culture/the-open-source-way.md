# The open source way
While the opportunities to contribute are boundless in a growing organization like Open Way Learning, they may not be clearly defined (the inherent nature of a startup organization). As mentioned at the outset of this handbook, you'll need to think creatively, speak up to see how you can help, and be willing to always try something new.

OWL is deeply committed to the open source ethos—values like transparency, collaboration, release early and often, inclusive meritocracy, and community. Not only do we believe in it, but we use it, and we give back to it—not just through OWL, but through contributions to other open source projects. Moreover, the open source ethos manifests itself in the following ways in how we do our work:

* Hiring and working from all over (instead of from a central location)
* Hiring people internally (i.e. from the OWL Fellow program) or through an informal network of friends, colleagues, and professional associates (instead of using headhunters or hiring platforms)
* Flexible working hours (over set working hours)
* Writing down and recording knowledge (over verbal explanations)
* Public sharing of information (over need-to-know access)
* Opening up documents for contribution by anyone (over top-down control of documents)
* The results of work (over the hours put in)
* Every idea gets heard, regardless of source (instead of only ideas from long-time employees)
* Formal communication channels (over informal communication channels and “water cooler talk”)
* A compensation structure that is based on our primary customer (teachers)

## Iteration on minimum viable products
We know and expect that iteration and customization are core to our value proposition, and are unique to both our impact on the way we operate and get things done. Working this way means you are expected to quickly deliver the minimum viable product based on local client needs and goals instead of waiting for approval from a manager to produce a polished, completed product.

While this can be a challenging practice to adopt at first, it's also liberating to be able to make mistakes, get feedback quickly, and course correct to reach a better outcome, faster. As our nonprofit grows and as the number of schools interested in shifting the paradigm of teaching and learning continue to increase, you'll have the freedom and empowerment to help the organization develop and codify the systems that will help us continually improve and sustain a legacy of excellence over the long term.

An MVP must always meet the expectations that a client articulates in an official contract, as well as meet minimum professional and quality criteria to reflect positively on the organization. When in doubt, ask for input from an employee.

## Open source licensing of materials
It is important that all employees fully understand how [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses are used, given that most of OWL’s client-facing materials are open source and licensed for use under a Creative Commons license. This means knowing if and when persons or entities can use our materials, as well as how we can reference and use materials from other entities—open source or otherwise.

We also take the intellectual property rights of other organizations and individuals very seriously and require that our employees do the same.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Any questions regarding the use or sharing of OWL materials or other intellectual property should be resolved by the President or COO before a final sharing decision is made.
