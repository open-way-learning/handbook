# How we conduct meetings
Synchronous time at OWL is a very valuable commodity. One of the ways we work to honor that time is by ensuring any meeting time you have to do is run efficiently and **adds distinct value to both your work and the work of your colleagues**.

## Value-added meetings
We ask all team members to adhere to the following expectations for any internal, ad hoc meetings:

* Start and end the meeting on time.
* Be present, or be elsewhere. In other words, if you are not going to be prepared and engaged, then don’t waste the time of your colleagues.
* Avoid large meetings that involve 6 or more people, unless you're certain that every participant is providing value to the whole audience.
* Avoid frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.
* Defer to short meetings (30 minutes) vs long meetings (1 hour or more) where possible.
* Every meeting should have a published agenda, ideally the day before it starts so that participants can prepare for efficient sync time to discuss and resolve important subjects. The agenda must include the meeting’s goals and deliverables (preferably no more than three).
* Synchronous OWL meetings should be based on topics that require verbal, face-to-face interaction (including on Zoom). In other words, we only discuss Live Topics in any synchronous OWL meeting, leaving Async Topics for "read only" response and follow up after the meeting. As such, all OWL meetings will include a Google Doc for notes (ideally included in the meeting invitation) for capture and follow up of Async Items so that they do not detract from the core agenda, goals, and deliverables. Where appropriate, important Async Topics should land in the OWL kanban (Productive platform) so that they do not get lost.  
* Avoid "informational" meetings that address items that could easily be handled via asynchronous communication such as email or Slack.

To ensure that we are holding ourselves accountable to these expectations, every OWL employee is fully empowered to leave or drop off a meeting that does not follow the above criteria or as soon as it becomes obvious you aren't adding value. The rule of thumb is that it is not rude to leave, but it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.

Note that OWL obviously cannot impose these expectations on persons outside the organization that lead meetings for which we participate. Nevertheless, you should model the value of meeting efficiency by emphasizing, as applicable, these expectations when you are given the opportunity to lead an external meeting. You are also welcome to lead through influence by sharing these expectations with non-OWL colleagues, where it is appropriate to do so.

## Other meeting norms
In addition to the above minimum expectations, OWL also encourages employees to adopt these norms/best practices in order to help OWL meetings be welcoming and safe spaces for open dialogue and problem solving.

### Remove distractions
We know that life happens, especially when working from home. And while we want to bring humanity to the process, we also want to help everyone remain focused on adding value in the time we are together. As such, work to remove distractions from your workspace during the time of the meeting.  

### Always be open and honest
State your views in a transparent manner and ask genuine questions if you do not thoroughly understand something. This enables the team to shift from monologues and arguments to a conversation in which members can understand everyone’s point of view and be curious about the differences in their views. This also means that we use a “Speak now, or forever hold your peace” approach to ensure that what needs to be discussed and resolved in a meeting (or in a formal follow up session) happens and does not devolve to "water cooler talk."

### Share all relevant information
This enables the team to develop a comprehensive, common set of information with which to solve problems and make decisions.

### Grounding via context
By using specific examples, the team can see and agree on what important words mean. This ensures that all team members are using the same words to mean the same thing.

### Explain reasoning and intent
This enables members to understand how others reached their conclusions and see where team members’ reasoning differs.

### Tackle issues, not people
By moving from arguing about solutions to identifying needs that must be met in order to solve a problem, you reduce unproductive conflict and increase your ability to develop solutions that the full team is committed to. Use a "don't make things personal, and don't take things personally" rule of thumb.  

### Test assumptions and inferences
This ensures that the team is making decisions with valid information rather than with members’ private stories about what other team members believe and what their motives are.   

### Notice and reflect on bias and systems of oppression
Similar to the above (and following the design process adopted by the [National Equity Project](https://www.nationalequityproject.org/)), take intentional pauses to reflect and notice how the work is proceeding so that it explicitly addresses issues of equity and inclusion and is not reinforcing systems of oppression.  

### Co-design next steps
OWL is small and nimble enough where we can strive for consensus wherever possible, including input from all stakeholders/users. This ensures that everyone is committed to moving forward together as a team.  

### Acknowledge the elephants in the room
This ensures that the team addresses the important but undiscussed issues that are hindering its results and that can only be resolved in a team meeting.  

### Follow the 40 second rule
Be aware of how long you have been speaking and find a way to hand it off to someone else. This helps share the air and encourages others to engage with the conversation. 

## Routine meetings
In addition to the ad hoc meetings described above, we also hold routine meetings. Open Way Learning conducts a weekly, 45 minute **operations stand up meeting** every first, second, and third Wednesday of the month at 11 am ET. It also conducts a **strategy retrospective meeting** on the last Wednesday of every month. All OWL employees are welcome to join.

Please make these meetings a priority! If you have to miss a Stand Up or Strategy meeting, be sure to provide an update via email or Zoom to another team member who can represent you during the meeting.  

The primary tool for these meetings is the [OWL Kanban board](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gx4gzzAm_YwBM5-2FuC9QreEBozfewgcDxMWIdhlTXA/edit?usp=sharing) in [Productive](https://app.productive.io/22109-open-way-learning/dashboards/64244). Please be familiar with this tool and the Kanban structure and format.

As the name implies, the Stand Up meetings are done while everyone is ideally standing up. This is optional, however, although the intent is not—i.e., to keep the scrum portion of the meeting moving at a brisk pace so that we cover what’s needed within the time allotted.

Each of these meetings is facilitated by a “scrum master” to ensure the meeting stays on track, tabled items are captured, and we accomplish what we set out to do. The role of scrum master may also be rotated each month to a "transitional scrum master" as the organization grows (with a debrief and feedback opposite the expectations articulated in this document).

Everyone is expected to come prepared to these meetings by knowing the status of any task/project on the OWL Kanban for which you lead or are involved with supporting. This includes updating your respective cards (status, board, comments, subtasks, due dates, etc.) per the following questions:

* What did you accomplish in the past week (note that Productive has a report called "Tasks closed by person" that will allow everyone an easy way to track what they've accomplished in the last month)?  
* What are you hoping to accomplish this coming week?
* Is there anything blocking you from getting your respective tasks completed on time?  
* What support do you need from the team or others? This is extremely important and means everyone has to have the vulnerable courage to ask for support. This includes requests for delegation or re-prioritization if you have more items than you have the bandwidth to properly manage or more than the Work In Progress (WIP) limit for any board.

### Operations stand up meeting agenda
(50 minutes with a 10-minute extension if needed)

1. Quick connections (5 minutes): For participants to briefly highlight how they are doing. This important time is seen as an investment in strengthening relationships, but is not meant to be a free-for-all. Consequently the time should be well respected through everyone’s preparation prior to the meeting.
2. 5 minutes of dedicated time to update Productive time, tasks, expenses, etc. **This is an essential task that is needed for correct invoices to happen in a timely manner so that we all get paid**. Also use this time to make sure you have **no overdue items** on the OWL kanban.
3. Scrum for 35 minutes:   
   1. Select “scrum master” to ensure the meeting stays on track, tabled items are captured, and we accomplish what we set out to do  
   2. Each task/project leader provides a very brief summary of any tasks/projects on the “Urgent” board (refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gx4gzzAm_YwBM5-2FuC9QreEBozfewgcDxMWIdhlTXA/edit?usp=sharing) to understand the criteria for “urgent” and other criteria in Productive). This includes highlighting work team members must complete within the next 1-2 weeks and prioritizing any tasks based on challenges/blockers that can quickly be resolved during this synchronous meeting (ones that cannot be quickly addressed are tabled for post-meeting or asynchronous follow up). Target \= 5 min.  
   3. Each task/project leader provides a very brief summary of any tasks/projects on the “Doing” board. This includes highlighting work team members must complete to keep the item on track per internal and external deadlines and commitments, as well as recategorizing any tasks to “Urgent” status based on challenges/blockers or to “To do” status if the item’s priority has dropped. As above, items that cannot be quickly addressed are tabled for post-meeting or asynchronous follow up. Target \= 12 min.  
   4. The team scans the “To-Do” category for any items that potentially need to be moved to “Doing.” If they are moved, then repeat the above step, as needed. Target \= 5 min.  
   5. Complete the last 10-15 minutes of the scrum by doing a quick assessment of the overall workflow of the past week and for the next week. This bird’s eye view helps identify holes in the process and see what additional follow up might be needed. This is also "swarm" time, where the team should verify items in any board do not exceed WIP limits and if they do, reprioritize or redelegate as needed. Scrum master documents tabled items in list available to all and uses for targeted follow up timing below and/or in a follow-up message to the team.
4. Commitments / appreciations (5 min): Wrap up the meeting with everyone articulating at least one commitment or improvement item and one appreciation to another team member.  
5. Targeted follow-up (10 minutes): This optional time is set aside for specific follow up to items that were tabled during the scrum. Note that the intent is not to bring each of these items to closure, but to identify what synchronous and asynchronous work is needed—who, what, and when.

### Strategy retrospective meeting
(60 minutes)

1. Connections: 10 minutes (max) per [this protocol](https://www.schoolreforminitiative.org/download/connections/).  
2. Choose a facilitator to keep the team moving on tasks and topics and a notetaker to record key shifts in a list for reference and make changes in the Productive kanban.  
3. Short Term Tactics (5 min, if required): Recognizing that critical tasks still must be addressed, the task/project leader will quickly provide a very brief summary of any tasks/projects on the “Urgent” board that requires immediate attention. This only focuses on highlighting work team members must complete within the next week and prioritizing of any tasks based on challenges/blockers that can quickly be resolved during this synchronous setting (ones that cannot be quickly addressed are tabled for post-meeting or asynchronous follow up).  
4. KPI Check-ins (10 minutes): Review the following KPIs in relation to the current and desired states for each to frame the remaining strategy discussions in the agenda.  
	* Clients (use the [OWL Heat Map](https://app.mural.co/t/owl6667/m/owl6667/1704630697135/651304abea9baf06f43848b1e1235d453d23fae2?sender=u69fbaf654a65553021fe0812) for bird’s eye view)  
	* Major grants
	* Successful events  
	* Reserves
5. Development and replenishment: 5 minutes of facilitated review and discussion relative to potential new tasks to add to the “Backlog” section of the OWL Kanban board or to move any tasks/projects from Backlog to Design, informed by the KPI review above as a way to identify any hidden gems that should be reprioritized by moving them into either the “To-Do” or “Doing” categories. Table any systemic issues that arise in this process so they may be addressed in Step 6 below.  
6. Workflow and delivery retrospective: 15 minutes to take an intentionally high level look at how well the team’s work is meeting internal requirements and client needs. Ideally this works best by reviewing recent feedback from evaluations, etc. although another way is to start with the “Done” board and work backwards to get a retrospective look at its progress, or lack thereof. As this happens, the facilitator should help the team avoid getting into the weeds by asking them to reflect on what is working well, what isn’t going as planned, and what can be improved to better address workflow, team dynamics, internal goals, and client expectations. Table any systemic issues that arise in this process so they may be addressed in the next step.  
7. Systems and strategy: 15 minutes to discuss issues that have arisen during the above two steps, including any potential interferences or gaps in the OWL Master Schedule in Productive. The facilitator helps the team focus on systemic strategies that the organization can use to better monitor, manage, and address blockers, risks, and progress. If the above steps provide a bird’s eye view of the Kanban, this is a view from outer space that looks at OWL’s overall strategy beyond what is currently in play, considering industry standards, market changes, potential partnerships, and other players in the ed space. Prioritize the items the team elevates based on their potential impact (e.g. ability to better meet client expectations and deliverables or their value opposite internal mission-aligned goals) and their relative feasibility. Wrap up this portion of the meeting by identifying the 1-3 critical items for improvement, including who will champion necessary synchronous and asynchronous follow up outside of this meeting. These should eventually land on the Kanban, either as stand alone initiatives or added to existing cards.
8. Celebrations: 5 minute wrap up with brags, commitments, and shout outs!

## Check-in meetings
In addition to the above standing meetings, OWL also expects that everyone in the organization has a "check in" meeting with their manager or a peer on at least a monthly basis (in the case of Directors, this meeting would be with a peer). These should be no longer than 30 minutes, but provide a forum for transparent, candid, two-way feedback so that it can foster individual and collective improvement. The following questions should be used as the basis of this check in:

* How are you doing? Are there any special events coming up?  
* What are your plans and priorities this month?  
* What has gone well this past month?  
* What has not gone so well this past month?  
* Where do you feel you’re growing or need to grow with your competencies?  
* How is everything going with people you work with/on your team?  
* Any interactions you’d like to discuss?  
* Any accomplishments or shoutouts you would care to highlight?  
* Do you have any questions about any recent OWL changes?  
* Is there anything can I help you with between now and the next time we meet?  
* Is there anything we didn’t cover that you’d like to discuss next time?  
* Do you have any feedback for me?
