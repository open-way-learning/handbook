# Open door policy
We encourage maximum communication between employees at all levels of the organization. This is an important part of our culture. Whenever problems or concerns arise, it is expected that they will be addressed as quickly as possible. Your immediate manager is the person who is closest to you and your work. When you need help or have questions, complaints, problems or suggestions, please contact your manager first. It is your manager's responsibility to assist youâ€”so please ask, and be willing to work the issue out with your manager. They are interested in your success, the success of every employee in their department, and the overall success of OWL.

If your manager cannot help you or answer your questions, your questions will be referred to someone who can. If you feel your particular question, concern or suggestion cannot be discussed with your manager, you are encouraged to contact the OWL Leadership Team or Board of Directors. It is important to remember that an employee who takes these steps will not be reproached. You can expect to be treated fairly and with respect.
