# Strategy Overview

We are first and foremost a mission driven organization. Thus, the best place to understand the “what, why, and how” behind Open Way Learning is by reviewing our [mission, vision, and values](/our-purpose/README.md).

Authentic innovation doesn’t come from chasing fads, it comes from building a culture where true innovation is baked into a school’s DNA—a culture that leverages the already existing skills and talent in an organization to constantly identify, refine, and scale powerful teaching and learning strategies that are proven to better meet individual student needs. This is the basis for why Open Way Learning came to be, not only as a nonprofit, but also as a process and mindset for disrupting the status quo of "doing school" the way it has always been done.

Highlighting research, best practices, and case studies, Open Way Learning uses a Design Thinking framework to provide any education stakeholder with the tools, strategies, and resources needed to do the hard work of shifting a school’s culture from the traditional industrial model to one that nimbly responds to the needs and assets of every student. This transformation will enable the school team to not only implement with fidelity and sustain over the long term learner-centered strategies such as Project Based Learning, Competency/Mastery Learning, Advisory, Experiential Education, Social & Emotional Learning, STEM/Makerspaces, etc., but also more efficiently and effectively respond to any challenges the school might face (including a global pandemic). This type of true innovation means the school is no longer force-fitting top-down driven “innovations,” but using the design process and improvement science to explicitly adapt what we know works with students so that it meets local needs, takes advantage of school and community assets, and better prepares students for a rapidly changing world. 

As an organization, Open Way Learning is officially a 501(c)3 nonprofit with a singular focus on helping schools develop, sustain, and scale the conditions needed so that every student finds the joy and wonder of what school can and should be—in other words, they love being at school because they can see themselves and their future in the things they are doing to make the world a better place—locally and globally—now, not later. 

The premise behind Open Way Learning’s work is based on three core beliefs: 

* Authentic innovation comes not from the traditional, inconsistent application of “buzzword strategies,” but when a learning community first attends to the difficult, but necessary development and the fostering of a school culture that allows continuous improvement and innovation to thrive.   
* Cultures of learner-centered innovation will thrive in schools that have the following four characteristics in place: a shared, living mission and vision; an intentional willingness to embrace collective leadership; a deep sense of systemic collaboration across the entire learning community; and the free and open exchange of ideas and resources. These elements then enable an atmosphere of powerful teaching and learning where all students are able to find relevance and meaning in their school experience.   
* The talent and skills needed to grow a culture of innovation already exist in any school or district. But rather than being encumbered by the institutionalized inertia of the status quo, schools can leverage these skills and talents through the application of “the open source way” (transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community), thus catalyzing crowdsourced, positive disruption to better prepare students for a rapidly changing world.

Open Way Learning advances the above beliefs by advocating for more open, equitable, and innovative teaching and learning strategies that have been proven to work through case studies, research, and other applicable evidence from and for public and independent k-12 schools. We work directly with schools and districts to use a Design Thinking framework to help bring the above beliefs to life in a local context and to then implement learner-centered strategies that include, but are not limited to Experiential Learning (such as Problem, Project, and Place-Based Learning), Mastery and Competency Based Education, STEM & Makerspace design and integration across all curricular areas, building strong relationships through Advisory programs, and blurring the lines between schools and local communities through efforts such as a Business Advisory Council and Profession-Based Learning networks. We do this work through targeted training, workshops, and coaching; presenting at conferences; offering virtual courses; conducting school study visits; blogs and routine writing and the use of social media; and developing strategic partnerships with other for and non-profit organizations that share similar goals. 

We also ensure that interactions like the above not only address short term capacity building, but also a long term focus on the systems and cultural elements that schools and their stakeholders will need to sustain and scale the work across an entire learning community. As such, we work hard with our partners to build collective efficacy and a network of support at the local level and beyond so that they can learn, share, and create together in service of building and advancing learner-centered models, systems, and structures across the country. This networking commitment is in full alignment with our vision that the kind of educational transformation that is needed in this country will not come from top down initiatives or any one institution, but will come from networked, crowdsourced change.

## Our theory of change
OWL’s theory of change is that authentic innovation in schools is built by attending to four core elements: a shared, living vision; collective leadership; systemic collaboration; and the free and open exchange of ideas and resources. These elements enable a culture of localized, learner-centered innovation to thrive, where members of the learning community are constantly looking for ways to improve the powerful teaching and learning environment for every student. 

## Customized approach rooted in the design process
OWL never provides canned, paint-by-numbers professional development per a scripted curriculum. Such one-size-fits-all programs or workshops are counter to our open source philosophy and our belief in the collaborative adaptation of best practices to help a school on its individual innovation journey. Everything we do is customized to meet local needs and goals, leveraging local assets and resources. The only constant is the use of Design Thinking in general and Liberatory Design in particular as the underlying framework for all its interactions, including collaborative educator workshops, follow-up coaching and co-design, and facilitated community and professional engagement.  
    
## 100% opt-in approach
We work directly with schools, districts, and other education networks and communities to help them leverage local assets and expertise to build sustainable cultures of authentic, learner-centered innovation so that they can better meet the individual needs and goals of every student, especially those who have historically been furthest from opportunity. We do this using an open, human-centered design process as the underlying framework for every interaction, thus ensuring that we remain grounded in empathy (i.e. student voice is considered at the outset and remains a throughline and calibration point in every aspect of the work), focused on co-designing localized prototypes that are refined in context (instead of the latest “edu-fads” that tend to be easier to implement, but much harder to sustain), and then scaling innovation through a 100% opt-in approach of crowdsourced sharing and networking that builds the collective efficacy needed to sustain and scale innovations over the long term. This stands in stark contrast to the typical, top-down driven mandate version of PD that too often only becomes the next “program of the month” or little more than re-packaged approaches that are driven by buzzwords and therefore lack the operational substance and local adaptation to truly affect the kind of culture change that is really needed.   
    
## Local, crowdsourced expertise
We firmly believe that the requisite knowledge, talent, and skills needed to grow a culture of innovation already exist in any school. Unfortunately, what we call the “institutionalized inertia of the status quo” too often encumbers the potency of these localized skills and talents that could otherwise be deployed to affect the systemic change that is needed. We proudly work with pioneering schools that are willing to leverage these local resources and assets and to step beyond the relative comfort of “what we’ve always done” in order to boldly ask the hard questions and tackle the structural norms that stifle innovation that could better serve students.   
    
## Open source ethos
The "open" in Open Way Learning is for [open source](/our-culture/the-open-source-way.md). We are fiercely committed to the ideal of open source and as such, do not require paid subscriptions or firewalls to access the materials and tools we develop to help schools innovate. Everything we develop is open source and available under a Creative Commons license. Moreover, when passionate educators are willing to leverage the power of organic networks and crowdsourced sharing of ideas that work, we bring positive disruption from within, modeling a new paradigm of powerful teaching and learning based on collaboration, open sharing, and innovation. This eventually leads to a tipping point, where more educators will be willing to join a "coalition of the willing," thus amplifying and scaling the impact to greater spheres of influence. This theory of change is exemplified in the disruptive power of the open source movement.  
    
## Long-term focus
We firmly believe that authentic innovation isn't going to come from the well-worn approach of jumping from one top-down driven fad to the next, based on the latest sexy strategy in the education space—all under the misguided assumption that "this time will be different." It will not. This is why we align our work to Peter Drucker’s famous quote, "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." As such, we help schools strategically plan and execute what is needed to address the difficult, but essential work needed to develop and foster a culture of innovation. This then allows the school to approach powerful, learner-centered strategies with the cultural ingredients in place so that they are implemented with fidelity and sustained over the long term—in other words, these strategies become rooted in the organization's cultural DNA instead of being little more than buzzwords that come and go.   
    
## Cultures of innovation
We believe that when the elements of a living mission and vision, [collective leadership](/our-culture/collective-leadership.md), systemic [collaboration](/our-culture/the-collaborative-culture-we-model-in-our-work.md), and the free exchange of ideas and resources are built into a school’s culture, it enables innovative, learner-centered teaching and learning strategies to thrive because they are now customized and adapted to local needs and assets, implemented with fidelity, and scaled in a more effective and efficient manner. Such strategies, which are often the initial focus, rather than the cultural elements that make them successful, are no longer being force-fit into a culture that does not support them, resulting in their being moved to the side for the next "innovation."
