# Definition of terms

## Board of Directors

The OWL Board of Directors, also known as the Board or nonprofit board, is the governing body of Open Way Learning. Its members focus on the high-level strategy, oversight, and accountability of the organization and other than the OWL Directors (defined below), is composed of unpaid volunteers in service of the OWL Mission and act as the legal voice for the nonprofit.

## OWL Directors

Open Way Learning Directors are OWL employees who manage, oversee, and are ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operations of the nonprofit. They include the Chief Innovation Engineer (also legally called the President in the OWL Bylaws) and the Chief Operating Officer.

## Employer

Open Way Learning (OWL), also known is this and other documents as the nonprofit.

## Employee

All full‐time, part‐time, and temporary employees. An employee is hired, provided compensation and applicable benefits, and has their work directed and evaluated by Open Way Learning opposite the nonprofit’s Mission & Vision.

## Full‐Time Employee

A Full Time OWL Employee regularly works at least 30 hours per week for Open Way Learning. Full-time employees follow a set schedule and job function established by OWL to guide their regular tasks. These employees are generally eligible for all the benefits provided by OWL.

## Part‐Time Employee

A Part Time Employee is someone who either regularly works less than 30 hours per week for Open Way Learning or works flexible hours or days over a given week or month. (e.g. the [OWL Coach role](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S6vGGD74AZ0_1Rnezf3olxzjeR_eanRIrPhpXeJ1eDA/edit?usp=sharing)). In the latter case, part time employees work on a case-by-case basis per specific project assignments that are performed per a [Statement of Work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1br4BXUVkxq2ASWy6z6U3c273ROUnRUc4n54Y9CiqwbM/edit?usp=sharing). Part time employees may be eligible for some of the benefits provided by OWL and their pay is subject to withholdings for federal and state income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare by OWL. Part-time employees are paid only per the hours they work.

## Exempt Employee

An Exempt Employee is an OWL employee who is paid on a salary basis (base salary) and is designed to compensate for all hours required to perform the job and meets the qualifications for exemption from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”). As such, exempt employees are not eligible to receive overtime pay, regardless of the amount of time worked in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in the course of a workweek. Generally, exempt employees include directors, managers, and other professionals who do direct client-facing work.

## Non‐Exempt Employee

A Non‐Exempt Employee can be a full or part time OWL employee who is paid an hourly rate and does not meet the qualifications for exemption from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”). For Non‐ Exempt Employees, an accurate record of hours worked must be maintained per Appendix D of the [OWL Code of Conduct & Ethics](our-policies/code-of-conduct-and-ethics.md). Open Way Learning will compensate non‐exempt employees in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Note that this classification does not guarantee employment for any specific length of time.

## Temporary Employee

An individual employed, either on a full‐time or part‐time basis, for a specific period of time less than six months. Temporary employees are entitled only to those benefits required by statute or as otherwise stated in this Handbook.

## Independent Contractor (also sometimes called freelancers, gig workers, or consultants)

An independent contractor is someone who contracts with OWL to provide specialized or requested services on one-off projects or retained on an as-needed basis (e.g the OWL Fellowship program). Note that the IRS defines an independent contractor as someone for whom the employer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not the means and methods of accomplishing the result (OWL uses this [IRS guidance document](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1779.pdf) to ensure this determination is made correctly). OWL does not withhold the independent contractor’s federal and state income taxes, doesn’t pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for the independent contractor, and does not cover independent contractors with workers’ compensation. Each contractor works under an [Independent Contractor Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Amx9PrVgE3YQ2YhXsfH4TOxkXTS-tWJ6AqV4QoSC7j0/edit?usp=sharing) (i.e. contract) that defines the scope, duration, and terms of the service to be provided and must be approved by both parties. Independent contractors are paid only per the terms of the ICA and are responsible for their own health insurance and retirement plans. Please refer to the [OWL Contractor Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Amx9PrVgE3YQ2YhXsfH4TOxkXTS-tWJ6AqV4QoSC7j0/edit?usp=sharing) for additional details.

## Volunteers

Volunteers provide time and service to Open Way Learning without benefit of compensation (receiving any compensation, including “in-kind” benefits will turn them into “employees” in the eyes of the law). Volunteers are also not covered by OWL’s workers' compensation insurance and may not claim a deduction for their time, or the value of their professional services, on their personal income tax returns.

## Interns

OWL engages with interns as a way to mentor future nonprofit or education leaders. Such interns can be volunteers, in which case they are not paid, or they may be classified as employees (exempt, non exempt, temporary, etc.), in which case they receive compensation. However, because unpaid internships have historically put women, people of color, and other historically marginalized groups at a disadvantage, OWL has a policy to ensure that all interns are paid at least minimum wage (even if such payment is not directly from OWL) and are subject to all other requirements of The Fair Labor Standards Act. Every OWL intern will have a written job description that provides expectations for the position and clarity on employment status and payment criteria.
