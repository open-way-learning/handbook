# The Collaborative Culture We Model in Our Work

OWL’s working philosophy (that everyone can contribute, regardless of title, tenure with the organization, etc.) means that everyone on our team is empowered to bring our mission and vision to life by making a positive, value-adding impact with everything they do. Every day. We are able to effectively model this approach because our team brings a vast and diverse array of experience (in and out of education) to the table. As such, no one should feel that they don't have to have the required degree, certification, minimum service time, or specific role that makes them less of a contributor to the important work OWL does or to the tools we use.&#x20;

This open, radically collaborative, collective leadership approach works because we're a team of passionate people who want to help each other, our nonprofit, and the educators we network with in the broader OWL community succeed. We learn from each other, challenge each other, and thank each other. The minimum that’s asked of you in such a collaborative culture is to come to the work everyday prepared to do whatever it takes to help shape the future of the organization as we strive to live our mission and vision!
