# Work We Do In and For Schools

Open Way Learning’s core focus is to help education practitioners see first hand how to bring cultures of learner-centered innovation within their own learning communities.

We do this through workshops, design sprints, coaching, and other targeted support to meet the very specific needs and goals of each school, district, organization, or network and use Human Centered Design as the foundational backbone and throughline in everything we do. 100% of these interactions (whether face-to-face, virtual, or hybrid) are customized and co-designed with the client to ensure local goals and needs are met, ideally leveraging local skills, talent, assets, and expertise. We simply do not do canned, one-size-fits-all professional development. The following is a partial list of the characteristics we strive to bring to each of these client interactions:

* We always start and end on time!
* Be aware of our impact on others
* Honor and celebrate each other’s humanity, including our differences
* Intentionally practice and share gratitude
* Lead with inquiry - uncover underlying motivations, assumptions, and goals
* Lean into discomfort, actively
* With positive intent, hold ourselves and others accountable (warm demander mindset)
* Actively engage with each other on challenges or conflicts in a timely way
* Strive to model a “show don't tell” approach
* Use a “less is more” approach to workshop design (minimum essential for the desired outcomes, remembering that too much choice is no choice - i.e. “analysis paralysis”)
* Model the design process as a constant throughline and framework
* Never lose sight of the big picture/why
* Use an overall workshop structure of new learning through images of possibility, time for independent/small group reflection, structured collaboration and open sharing, and then application of the learning to local context.
* Incorporate local expertise, assets, language, and culture wherever possible
* Provide lots of work time, but with structure/goals/exemplars to maximize focus and understanding
* Build relationships with all participants, especially those who are struggling or might not want to be there
* Be intentional about grouping to maximize diversity of ideas and efficient application of learning
* Ask for frequent feedback and be willing to pivot&#x20;
* Have an "accordion" schedule that identifies key deliverables and built in flexibility/options
* Individualize the support for participants whenever possible
* Model protocols and activities that work with students
* Offer lots of participant voice & choice
* Where possible, bring in outside voices, especially students and community
* Always include morning & afternoon body & brain breaks
* Base everything on active learning - hands-on, experiential, lots of movement, and hard fun
* Check in with the norms - early & often - and strive to have participants own them
* Model prototyping and critique & revision (skateboard to...) vs. tendency to strive for perfection
* Always think: How am I shrinking the change and clearing the path for change?
* Provide time for self reflection after activities and at the end of the day
* End the day/workshop with a crescendo (tap into the emotion of the work)

Note that [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hV\_ih2\_98p5\_J63su9xibnsJi-\_fSBcDHRF3gJxtbPQ/edit?usp=sharing) can be used as a way to quantify the above attributes following each workshop or client-facing interaction.

We also ensure that these interactions not only address short term capacity building, but also a long term focus on the systems and cultural elements that local practitioners and supporters will need to sustain and scale the work across the entire learning community. We also ensure that our clients are able to build networks of community support at the local level and beyond so that they can learn, share, and create together in service of building and advancing learner-centered models, systems, and structures across the country. This networking commitment is in full alignment with our vision that the kind of educational transformation that is needed in this country will not come from top down initiatives or any one institution, but will come from networked, crowdsourced change.
