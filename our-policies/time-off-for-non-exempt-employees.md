# Time off for non exempt employees
While the full Flexible Paid Time Off policy outlined above is only available to full time, exempt employees, when full time, non exempt employees want to take time away from work, they are afforded ample time to do so. This includes paid time and paid holidays, in addition to other leave and medical accommodation options that are available for mental and physical health concerns. Applicable cases and guidelines for such time off is described below:

## Non exempt personal days
Full time, non exempt employees are granted five personal leave days each calendar year, accrued bi-weekly. Personal leave days are pro-rated in the first year of hire, depending upon date of hire and at date of termination. Because part time, non exempt employees work under a variable hour, flexible schedule, they are not eligible for personal days.

The employee must notify their manager of the intent to take personal leave days with as much advance notice as possible. Two weeks is generally considered reasonable notice, however there may be times when less notice is appropriate. Personal Days may be accrued up to a maximum of 10 days. If you leave OWL for any reason, you will be paid all earned but unused personal days based upon the above accrual rate. An employee cannot receive pay in lieu of personal days except upon the termination of their employment, and employees may not use more personal days than they have accrued.

## Non exempt vacation days
Full time, non exempt employees earn vacation hours per the table below. These hours are paid at the employee’s regular straight-time rate of pay at the time the vacation is taken. Part time employees are not eligible for paid vacation.

| Length of service  | Accrual hours for each pay period | Maximum annual days | Maximum accrual hours |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| 0 – 12 months | 6 | 9 | 9 |
| 12 to 72 months | 12 | 18 | 36 |
| 73 months or more | 20 | 30 | 60 |

Not taking vacation is not something to boast about. In fact, you are doing OWL a disservice by being a single point of failure by burning yourself out. As such, full time, non exempt employees are expected to use their paid vacation benefits each year. As an incentive to do so, employees cannot accrue more paid vacation than they earn in a 24-month period, as noted in the above table. Once an employee reaches their maximum accrual, they will not earn more paid vacation time until some of the accrued vacation is used. Pay is also not granted in lieu of using accrued vacation during employment.

As with personal days, approval by the employee’s manager is necessary for all vacations. Vacation days may be taken before they are accrued, up to 24 hours. Beyond that, vacation days taken prior to being accrued will be unpaid. Requests for vacation should be given to your manager at least two weeks prior to the actual vacation. 

If a fulltime, non exempt employee resigns or is terminated, they will be paid, at their current rate of pay, for any earned but unused paid vacation up to the maximum accrual.

## Non exempt sick days
Full time and part time non exempt employees are eligible for sick days per the following criteria:

* Full time non exempt employees will accrue 3.46 hours per pay period, for a maximum accrual of 450 hours.  
* non exempt employees working less than 35 hours per week will accrue sick time prorated to the percentage of full-time employment.   
* Variable hour, part time employees working less than 30 hours per week will accrue sick leave at a rate of 1 hour for every 30 hours worked, with a maximum accrual of 72 hours.

Accrued and unused sick time does not retain any cash value to employees upon termination. Paid sick time may be used by employees for the employee’s own need or that of an [eligible Family Member](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/part-825) for one or more of the following qualifying reasons:

1. The employee is ill or injured or otherwise must attend an appointment for medical diagnosis, care or treatment for an existing medical condition, or for preventative care.  
2. The employee is needed to care for a Family Member who is ill or injured, or who needs the employee’s assistance/support to attend an appointment for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment for an existing medical condition, or for preventative care.  
3. The employee is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, and needs time off work for their physical or mental health or safety needs or that of their dependents.

## Holidays
Full and part time employees are not expected to work on the following holidays:

| US Holiday | Canadian Equivalent / Replacement |

When a recognized holiday falls on a Saturday, it will generally be observed on the Friday before the holiday. Recognized holidays that fall on a Sunday will generally be observed on the following Monday. If a designated holiday falls within a regular full-time, non exempt employee’s paid vacation, the holiday is not considered a vacation day. 

For each holiday, non exempt, full-time employees are paid a full day’s wages. Part-time employees do not receive holiday pay, but take holidays on an unpaid basis.

## Bereavement leave
Non exempt employees will be granted up to 5 days of paid leave per calendar year in the event of a death of a family member, including your spouse or domestic partner, parent and parent in-law, grandparent and grandparent-in-law, sibling, child, grandchild, or another relative who resides with you.

## Jury/witness duty
Employees will be granted paid leave if called to serve as a juror or witness in a legal proceeding. Upon receipt of a jury duty notice or subpoena,the employee must promptly furnish a copy of such notice or subpoena to their manager, along with a written request for time off, so that necessary provisions can be made in the employee’s absence.
