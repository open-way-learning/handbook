# Overtime pay
Overtime pay, which is applicable only to full and part time Non‐Exempt Employees, is for any authorized time worked in excess of 40 hours in a work week.  Only the employee’s direct manager or the OWL Leadership Team may authorize overtime. Overtime rate is one and one‐half time (1½) the employeeʹs straight time rate, except in instances involving a Sunday or holidays when the rate is two times the regular rate.

Payment of overtime will be provided in the pay period following the period in which it is earned.
{% endhint %}

Open Way Learning must have accurate records of time worked in order to calculate overtime pay. As such, accurately reporting time worked is the responsibility of every non exempt employee.
