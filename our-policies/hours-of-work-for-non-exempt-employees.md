# Hours of work for non exempt employees
Full and part time, non exempt employees are expected to follow a more standardized work schedule than the flex hours described above, although the employeeâ€™s manager (or the OWL Leadership Team) can approve alternative, flexible hours of work that best suit the needs of the nonprofit and the individual employee. Such approval will be on a case-by-case basis and include formal documentation of the agreed upon schedules, including specific work commitments and including requirements for attendance at applicable meetings. The following are example of non exempt work schedules: 

| Percent time / core hours | Work start & end times |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 100% = 40 hours per week | 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday (inclusive of two 15 minute breaks and one, 1 hour unpaid lunch). |
| 100% = 20 hours per week | 8 a.m. to 12 p.m., Monday through Thursday, plus 4 hours of flex time during the week. |

Business needs may require that employees work a different schedule on an ongoing basis or from time-to-time.

Flexible schedules may also be revised or terminated at any time by OWL without prior notice.
