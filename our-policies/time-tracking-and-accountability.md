# Time tracking and accountability
The majority of OWLâ€™s income is from specific client contracts, as well as grants and restricted donations. Each of these types of funding sources require a high level of accountability and expense validation to ensure the source funds are being managed as intended by Open Way Learning. As such, every full and part time OWL employee who works on any task or activity that is tied to a client contract, grant, or restricted donation is required to accurately track and record their work time in a way that can be verified and audited, if required.

Refer to [Appendix D of the OWL Code of Conduct & Ethics](/code-of-conduct-and-ethics#appendix-d-timekeeping-policy) for additional details.
