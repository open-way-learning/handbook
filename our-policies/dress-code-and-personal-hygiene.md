# Dress code and personal hygiene
Our current and potential clients make decisions about the quality of our services based primarily on their interaction with our team, often using first impressions as the determining factor regarding whether to enter into a formal agreement or to take a pass. As such, OWL expects employees to dress professionally whenever interacting with clients, whether that interaction is live or virtual (e.g. a Zoom call).

Also, because our work is almost exclusively in school settings, where a higher degree of formality is generally expected, especially at the leadership level, professional business casual attire is a minimum rule of thumb (use this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/04/15/returning-to-the-office-what-is-the-dress-code-now/?sh=27ad02992fbb) as an example of what that means). In short, employees are expected to demonstrate good judgment and professional taste when determining whether they are dressing in attire that is appropriate for the situation.

Employees who wear business attire that is deemed inappropriate in the workplace will be dealt with on an individual basis rather than subjecting all employees to a more stringent dress code.

When attending any public-facing events, client or partner meetings, or other events such as workshops or presentations, kindly keep in mind you are representing OWL. As such, OWL employees are also expected to adhere to established and reasonable hygiene norms which ensure that they are presenting themselves to our clients in a way that reflects positively on OWL as an organization. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Maintaining personal cleanliness by bathing regularly and practicing good oral hygiene.  
* Using deodorant/antiperspirant to minimize body odors throughout the workday, especially when interacting with clients in settings such as workshops.  
* Not wearing heavily scented perfumes, colognes, etc. that could cause allergic reactions, migraines, or respiratory difficulty for other employees or clients.
