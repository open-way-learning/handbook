# Religious accommodations
OWL will endeavor to reasonably accommodate the religious beliefs of our employees to the extent such accommodation does not pose an undue hardship on the operation of our business. If an employee believes they need accommodation to perform the job duties because of a religious belief, the employee should submit a written request to the OWL Leadership Team.
