# Solicitation
The purpose of this policy is to establish OWL's intent to have a work environment that is free from solicitation efforts that do not relate to OWL's core mission. While OWL actively encourages employees' participation in community activities and organizations outside of work, the time spent at work is more productive and pleasant when not interrupted by solicitations and distribution of materials by employees, including for membership, pledges, subscriptions, the collection of money or for any other unauthorized purpose during work time, especially those of a partisan or political nature. Employees may not solicit on work time (when either the employee or the person being solicited is on work time). Employees may not distribute any literature or other non-work related materials either on work time, except when written approval has been provided by the OWL Leadership Team.
