# Employment policies and practices
All newly-hired regular and temporary, part-time, and full-time employees must complete federal and state employee withholding forms ([W-4](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf) and [NC-4](https://www.ncdor.gov/taxes-forms/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-forms-and-instructions/employees-withholding-allowance-certificate-nc-4)) in order to be paid.  All contractors must complete [W-9](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) Form, [Request for TIN and Certification](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9), in order to be paid.

All newly-hired regular and temporary, part-time, and full-time employees are subject to the [I-9](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9) employment verification process if they are physically performing work for the OWL in the United States.

Section 1 of the I-9 Form must be completed by the employee no later than the day the employee begins employment. Section 2 of the I-9 Form must be completed within three business days after the employee begins employment. If the employee is unable to present acceptable document(s) by the third business day after beginning employment, that employee cannot be allowed to continue to work until such documents are in order. The backdating of I-9 Forms is prohibited.

Employees must also ensure that their emergency contact information is on file in the OWL Personnel Records. Use [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MieqhFQhi9tG3A79S76o03T0T8xlu4fiwOB_tdBqwCQ/edit?usp=sharing) to provide this information and send it to your manager or the OWL Bookkeeper.
