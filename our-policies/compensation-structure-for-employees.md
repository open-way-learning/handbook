# Compensation structure for employees
Open Way Learning has as its primary objective to provide a reasonable and competitive total compensation opportunity to all employees, consistent with reasonable compensation practices that are typical for the education nonprofit market, so that we can attract and retain individuals possessing the experience and skills needed to support our mission and vision.

As such, OWL’s compensation program is designed to:

* Reinforce OWL’s core values by making OWL a great place to work in terms of work/life balance.  
* Balance the need to maintain long term sustainability within the limits of available financial resources.  
* Provide a competitive overall compensation and benefits package that includes the following components:   
  * A fair, reasonable, and equitable base pay for all full time, exempt employees.  
  * An average starting hourly wage for non exempt and part time employees that is well above the federal minimum wage.  
  * A shared surplus pay for all full time employees when total annual revenue exceeds budget projections (note that this “bonus pay” is not an annual guarantee and is described in more detail in [Appendix B of the OWL Code of Conduct & Ethics](https://open-way-learning.gitbook.io/handbook/our-policies/code-of-conduct-and-ethics#appendix-b-board-of-directors-code-of-ethics)
  * Flexible Paid Time Off for all exempt employees and a generous paid and unpaid time off package for other full and part time employees (described above).  
  * A generous benefits package (described above).  
* Ensure that all of our compensation packages fully comply with all state and federal laws and regulations. Specifically, the IRS requires that any nonprofit employee's entire compensation package be reasonable and in furtherance of the organization's tax exempt purpose.

OWL uses comparable nonprofit organizations within the education space to inform and benchmark employee base pay, including released surveys and 990 reports. In general, OWL's goal is to position its total compensation package, including benefits, to be at the approximate median of this market range, while also being flexible on a case-by-case basis to attract and retain specific talent essential for the nonprofit's growth and sustainability.

Hourly compensation for all full and part time, non exempt employees is managed by the OWL Leadership Team, subject to review by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is also responsible for establishing and reviewing the compensation of all full time, exempt employees, including OWL’s Directors, on an annual basis.
