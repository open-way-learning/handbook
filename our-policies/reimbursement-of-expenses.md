# Reimbursement of expenses
Reimbursement is authorized for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in carrying out job responsibilities, including, but not limited to mileage, parking fees, airfare, lodging, and meal costs when required to attend a work-related function. Expenses should be submitted within 90 days of purchase. Additional details for reimbursement are found in the [OWL Travel Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lvw8vxFSF2Qf0LbIIPfAN4ur2GNZEkgTKLCkuOhJ0o/edit?usp=sharing).

OWL may also pay for employees to attend a conference or professional meeting related to their professional development and/or Open Way Learning’s current and anticipated work.  Expenses for these purposes may be paid by Open Way Learning, if funds are available and the employee obtains prior written approval from the OWL Leadership Team.

The following technology reimbursement is also available to full-time employees. (Part-time employees are not reimbursed for IT expenses.):

* **Cell phone**: Up to $80 per month.  
* **Home internet**: Up to $80 per month (to enable subscription to an Internet provider that has 5MB upload/50MB download capability).

Reimbursement claims should be submitted each month via Productive.

The following documentation must also be available for auditing purposes to support reimbursement claims:

* **Cell phone**: Copy of monthly bill. Specifically, the first page with the totals for your portion of the account. If you have a family plan, please list the monthly expense that matches your portion of the bill. Only the employee’s portion of the bill that relates to OWL work is reimbursable.  If you purchase a new cell phone and roll this cost into your monthly bill, the cost of a new device/cell phone and related insurance on the device is not reimbursable.  If the cost of your service is under $80, enter the actual amount. If the cost of your service is over $80, then enter the max of $80.   
* **Home internet**: Copy of monthly bill with internet services itemized. If you have combined services (like DVR, Internet, sports TV), you may be able to find a breakdown of your services on your service provider's website. If not, then charge up to $80 as it makes sense against your bill (for example if you have three services, divide the bundled monthly charge by three).
