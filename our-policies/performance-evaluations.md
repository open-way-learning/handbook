# Performance evaluations
Every Open Way Learning employee is subject to an annual 360 performance review from their direct manager and/or the OWL Leadership Team. This is an opportunity to engage in discussions between the employee and their manager to reflect and learn how they are meeting or exceeding expectations and how they can improve and grow relative to the organization’s mission and vision. It is NOT intended to be a punitive exercise and should provide a safe environment for the employees to openly discuss their individual performance opposite goals and expectations, as well as the performance of the organization as a whole. The discussion can include, but is not limited to topics such as:

The employee's direct manager will initiate the 360 performance review process by informing the employee at least two weeks prior to the formal review, giving them enough notice to prepare. The manager may also collect the information regarding the employee’s performance from other stakeholders—i.e., 360 feedback. 

* Quality of work  
* Attitude  
* Knowledge of work  
* Job skills  
* Attendance and punctuality  
* Teamwork and cooperation  
* Compliance with company policy  
* Past performance reviews  
* Continuous improvement  
* Acceptance of responsibility and constructive feedback

Employees should note that a performance review does not guarantee a pay increase or promotion. The employee may also appeal cases where they feel a performance review or other personnel action was unfair or did not fully reflect their performance. Employees are expected first to discuss their concern with their immediate manager, but if further discussion is desired, the employee may then discuss the situation with the OWL Leadership Team. The review and the response (if there is one) are placed in the employee’s personnel file.

Finally, remember that you are the main driver in your career. You don't need to wait for your manager to tap you on the shoulder and ask if you are ready for a performance review that can lead to a promotion increase in pay! You are ultimately your own manager and are empowered to advocate for yourself! 

If you feel that you deserve a promotion or pay increase then start by documenting your unique and explicit worth to the organization. Develop the case to support yourself and your request, with as many facts and figures as possible, including why you deserve a raise and what size raise you are looking for. At that point, set up a formal 360 review with your manager so that you can make your case in an open and transparent manner.
