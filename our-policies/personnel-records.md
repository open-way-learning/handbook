# Personnel records
OWL respects the confidentiality of the personal information of employees and contractors. This includes employee and contractor medical and personnel records. All employee records are securely kept by the OWL Administrative Assistant or Bookkeeper. Team members may request access to their personnel records at any time. Access to personal information of others is only authorized when there is a legitimate and lawful reason, and access is only granted to appropriate personnel.

Requests for confidential employee or contractor information from anyone outside our organization under any circumstances must be approved by the OWL Leadership Team in accordance with applicable laws. It is important to remember, however, that employees and contractors should have no expectation of privacy with regard to normal workplace communication on any personal property used for OWL business.

Personnel records include the employeeâ€™s job application, copy of the letter of employment and position description, performance reviews, disciplinary records, records of salary increases and any other relevant personnel information.  It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify their manager in writing of any changes in personnel data, including personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, names of dependents, and individuals to be contacted in the event of an emergency.
