# COVID-19 safety protocols 
Per the continued presence of COVID-19 variants in public spaces, the Open Way Learning Board of Directors have specified that for safety and liability purposes, all Open Way Learning employees must ensure that any face-to-face work be done strictly in alignment with the latest Center for Disease Control criteria, as well as all additional directives from the applicable state and local authorities. The following are a set of safety guidelines for facilitating in-person workshops and reflect OWL’s commitment to the wellbeing, health, and safety of OWL employees, our partners, and our clients.

These protections are intended to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19 while traveling or delivering in-person services, but such risk cannot be completely eliminated.

First and foremost, no employee or contractor is expected to facilitate any in-person services if they are not comfortable doing so. Let your manager or the OWL Leadership Team know if you have any reservations regarding face-to-face interaction with clients so that reasonable accommodations can be made. Also remember that all employees are ultimately responsible for their own protection from COVID-19 through best practices that include social distancing, masking, routine hand washing, and remaining current with all vaccinations and boosters. That said, your ability to represent OWL in on-site facilitation of services is contingent upon your agreeing to follow these minimum essential best practices, as well as the following safety guidelines:

* Knowing the CDC Community Level designation at the time of service of the site where you will be facilitating.  
* Consistent and correct use of masks while conducting air travel, as well as during the service if it is in a location at the CDC Community Level designation of “High” at the time of the service. *Note that while you can encourage others to do the same, you are not expected to require other non-OWL participants to also follow this requirement.*  
* Following all appropriate hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, regardless of the CDC Community Level designation. This includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, or touching surfaces in public places.   
* Avoid close contact with any persons who are sick.  
* Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated spaces.  
* Avoid touching your face, nose, eyes, etc. with unwashed hands.   
* To the extent possible, avoid contact with high-touch surfaces in public places such as elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with people, etc.   
* Verifying that hand sanitizer and other cleaning and disinfection options are available for use by participants (hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol).  
* Verifying that the surfaces and materials at the service location appear to be clean and hygienic.  
* Letting your manager or the OWL Leadership Team know if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 within 7 days of delivering an in-person service. Alternative arrangements will be made so that you do not have to facilitate a service while sick. You must also have a negative COVID test before resuming any on-site services.
