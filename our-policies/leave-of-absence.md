# Leave of absence
OWL allows all employees to take an extended, unpaid leave of absence without penalty for situations where the employee may be disabled from working or may need to be away from work for civic duty, family care, or personal reasons, including any of the following situations: 

* Care of the employee’s newborn child in the first twelve months, including newly adoption and newly placed foster child into foster care.  
* Care of the employee’s own serious health condition (includes pregnancy/birth of child).  
* Care of an immediate family member (spouse, son, daughter, or parent) who has a serious health condition.  
* Extended FMLA leave time may be allowed if the medical need of the family member is due to military duty (Military Caregiver Leave).  
* As a parent, guardian, or person standing in loco parentis of a school-aged child so that the employee may attend or otherwise be involved at that child's school.  
* Pregnancy/childbirth disability leave for any employee whose health care provider certifies that the employee is temporarily disabled from performing her job because of pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition (note that this is in addition to the Parental Leave described above).  
* Leave for qualifying emergency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, registered domestic partner, son, daughter, or parent is on active duty or called to active duty status as a member of the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation.  
* The employee wishes to enter an adult literacy program (limited to six weeks of leave).  
* Military leave of absence to serve in the uniformed military services, including active duty, active training, initial active duty for training, full-time National Guard duty, or absences for examinations to determine fitness for duty.  
* If an employee’s current spouse is on deployment in the Armed Forces, National Guard or Reserves, the employee may be eligible to take up to ten days of unpaid leave while their spouse is on leave from deployment.  
* Any employee who is a volunteer member of the U.S. Air Force Civil Air Patrol or other emergency response organization and is responding to an emergency operation mission.  
* Any employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking may take time off, as needed, to obtain relief or to attempt to obtain relief—by means such as but not limited to restraining orders or other injunctive relief—to help ensure the health, safety or welfare of the employee and/or the employee’s child.

OWL may also, at its discretion, grant employees who have completed at least 12 months of service to take a personal, unpaid leave of absence. Personal leave is generally limited to 6 months. Before a personal leave will be granted to non exempt employees, they must have exhausted all of their accrued vacation and personal time, including sick time if applicable to leave circumstances.

Employees who can anticipate the need for a leave of absence should notify their manager to discuss their unique leave circumstances and options (i.e. eligibility, length of leave, job protection, etc.)

Thirty (30) days advance notice is ideal, but understandably, not always feasible. Employees will not be discriminated or retaliated against for taking authorized leaves of absence. Failure to return from a leave of absence on the first working day following the expiration of the leave will be deemed a resignation on the part of the employee.
