description: Open Way Learning's Code of Conduct and Ethics
---

# Code of conduct and ethics
Open Way Learning is committed to the highest standards of legal and ethical business conduct and operates its business consistent with written operating principles and policies that reinforce this commitment. This Code of Conduct & Ethics (Code) adopted by OWL's Board of Directors (Board) summarizes the ethical standards for all directors, officers, and employees (sometimes identified as Team Members) of Open Way Learning and is a reminder of the seriousness of our commitment to our values. Compliance with this Code is mandatory for every employee. In addition to this Code, employees are subject to and must comply with other applicable policies and programs of Open Way Learning. Note that for the purpose of this document, Open Way Leaning is known as "OWL" or "The Nonprofit."

## Introduction
Our business as an education nonprofit is complex in terms of the locations, contexts, and cultures in which we function, as well as the various laws and regulations with which we must comply. To help employees understand what is expected of them and to carry out their responsibilities in as consistent a way as possible, we have created this Code. Responsibility for overseeing adherence to this Code shall rest with the Chief Operations Officer (COO), under the direction of the Board.

This Code represents a non-exhaustive list of employment compliance matters that every employee should be aware of and keep in mind when communicating with OWL stakeholders, partners, clients, vendors, contractors, or the general public. It also provides the foundational basis for all internal communication, interaction, and decisions. No single document can serve as a complete guide for every situation, but what it does do is set the overall tone and tenor for the abundance of employment compliance matters that we must not only adhere to, but the importance of why careful communication is a minimum expectation of employment with Open Way Learning. In short, this Code provides a minimum essential set of rules that we expect all Open Way Learning employees to abide by in order to promote the orderly and efficient operation of the organization, as well as protect the rights of all stakeholders we interact with in the course of our work. 

Finally, these rules are published for your information and protection and ignorance of the details of this Code is not an acceptable excuse for violation. Moreover, all employees are expected to be familiar with applicable laws and regulations in their area of operation, and OWL expressly prohibits any activity by employees that violates any applicable law or regulation. Violations of the law, our policies, or this Code may result in disciplinary action, including dismissal.

## Employee statement
Unless an employee has a written employment agreement with Open Way Learning, which provides differently, all employment at Open Way Learning is "at‐will." That means that employees may be terminated from employment with Open Way Learning with or without cause, and employees are free to leave the employment of Open Way Learning with or without cause. Any representation by any Open Way Learning officer or employee contrary to this policy is not binding upon Open Way Learning unless it is in writing and approved by the OWL Board. 

## Equal employment opportunity
Open Way Learning follows the spirit and intent of all federal, state and local employment law and is committed to equal employment opportunity. To that end, the Board of Directors and all officers of Open Way Learning will not discriminate against any employee or applicant in a manner that violates the law. Open Way Learning is committed to providing equal opportunity for all employees and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, personal appearance, family responsibilities, matriculation or any other characteristic protected under federal, state or local law. 

Each person is evaluated on the basis of personal skill and merit. Open Way Learning's policy regarding equal employment opportunity applies to all aspects of employment, including recruitment, hiring, job assignments, promotions, working conditions, scheduling, benefits, wage and salary administration, disciplinary action, termination, and social, educational and recreational programs. The COO shall act as the responsible agent in the full implementation of the Equal Employment Opportunity policy. 

Open Way Learning will not tolerate any form of unlawful discrimination. All employees are expected to cooperate fully in implementing this policy and any employee who believes that any other OWL employee may have violated the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy should report the possible violation to the Chair of the Board. If the Board determines that a violation of this policy has occurred, it will take appropriate disciplinary action against the offending party, which can include counseling, warnings, suspensions, and termination. Employees who report, in good faith, violations of this policy and employees who cooperate with investigations into alleged violations of this policy will not be subject to retaliation. Upon completion of the investigation, the Board will inform the employee who made the complaint of the results of the investigation. 

## Individuals with disabilities policy
Open Way Learning fully complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and all applicable state, provincial, and other applicable local laws, which make it unlawful to discriminate in employment against a qualified individual with a disability. OWL prohibits discrimination against team members and applicants with disabilities in all aspects of employment. Our commitment to this policy includes making reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified individuals\* with disabilities to enable them to perform the essential functions of their jobs, unless doing so would pose an undue hardship on our business, would pose a direct threat of substantial harm to the team member or others, or is otherwise not required by applicable law. 

The roles and responsibilities specific to this policy include the following:

* The applicant may request reasonable accommodations to assist them in the application process or to enable performance of the essential functions of the position for which they are applying and are otherwise qualified to perform.
* Employees who believe that they may require accommodation or adjustment at work due to a medical condition in order to perform their job should discuss these needs with their manager or the COO.
* The manager or COO will act as the subject matter expert (SME) as it relates to the essential functions of the team member’s job, order any equipment needed as it relates to the accommodation, ensure the team member is trained properly on any equipment and it is regularly serviced (if applicable), and follow up with the employee if the accommodations are not helping them perform their job or their performance is not meeting expectations.
* The Chair of the Board, if needed, will serve as a liaison between manager, employee/candidate, and the employee’s or candidate’s physician.

Qualified individuals with disabilities are defined as individuals with disabilities who can perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodation. Per the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a disability means, with respect to an individual: a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment as described in Section 36.105, paragraph (f) of the ADA. Such disabilities can include, but are not limited to:

* Developmental disabilities, for example, cerebral palsy or autism spectrum disorder
* Traumatic brain injuries
* Deafness or serious difficulty hearing, benefiting from, for example, American Sign Language
* Blindness or serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses
* Missing extremities (arm, leg, hand and/or foot)
* Significant mobility impairments, benefitting from the utilization of a wheelchair, scooter, walker, leg brace(s) and/or other supports
* Partial or complete paralysis (any cause)
* Epilepsy and other seizure disorders
* Intellectual disabilities (formerly described as mental retardation)
* Significant psychiatric disorders, for example, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD, or major depression
* Dwarfism
* Significant disfigurement, for example, disfigurements caused by burns, wounds, accidents, or congenital disorders

Pregnancy accommodation is also governed by the ADA, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and numerous state and local laws. If you need a temporary change to how, when, or where you work due to pregnancy or related conditions, you may request an accommodation under this policy. A team member in need of a reasonable accommodation should make OWL aware of their request by notifying their manager or the COO. Refer to the Paid Time Off policy in the [Employee Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rs3qNf9kyUbKtqZVawR6pAHgAD2xsmgxRU2GZuUOFC8/edit?usp=sharing) for details regarding time off for family or maternity reasons.

Also note that not all disabilities are obvious to the eye. These are known as invisible disabilities. An invisible disability is a physical, mental, or neurological condition that can’t be seen from the outside. But it can impact someone’s movements, senses, or activities, according to the [Invisible Disabilities Association](https://invisibledisabilities.org/). Some examples of invisible disabilities include autism spectrum disorder, depression, diabetes, and learning and thinking differences such as ADHD and dyslexia. Invisible disabilities can also include symptoms such as chronic pain, fatigue, and dizziness.

OWL values all team members for their strengths. We offer team members with disabilities—whether visible or invisible— an equal opportunity to succeed, to learn, to be compensated fairly, and to advance. True inclusion is about embracing differences.

## Respectful work environment

A fair, inclusive and respectful community is vital to all individuals and is essential to OWL’s mission. Therefore, OWL embraces the concept of a Respectful Workplace as a guiding principle and is committed to promoting an environment where employees respect each other regardless of their roles, levels of responsibilities, or the nature of their contributions. OWL also recognizes its responsibility to lead by example, being a model organization that provides leadership regarding issues of openness, transparency, collegiality, civility, and respect. 

OWL is dedicated to providing an inclusive experience for everyone regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion (or lack thereof), or any other categories protected by local, state, provincial, or federal law. 

OWL’s goal is to cultivate an environment in which everyone feels welcomed, secure and positively engaged. If at any time a team member feels that this environment has been violated in any way, they should reach out to a Director or Board Chair or any Board member (contact information found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B4OSl0HHguTf9Y0JhnTwXKSO-vRAQmtpJwTWo6Wi3Vo/edit?usp=sharing)). 

Moreover, all OWL team members are expected to abide by the following behavior expectations:

* Use OWL’s core values to guide all interactions;
* Treat all team members with respect, civility, and courtesy, while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here. We want every interaction to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected categories;
* Recognize and acknowledge the value and contributions of all members of our community, regardless of status, time of service, or role in the organization, while also recognizing that each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether expressed or implied;
* Always work honestly, effectively and collegially with peers, clients, partners, and others;
* Respect and value the views and opinions of others, even though they may differ from our own;
* Strive to create a safe environment where all team members are free to express their opinions and suggestions in a non judgemental atmosphere; 
* Default to transparency and inclusion in all decisions and actions unless there is a clear justifiable reason not to do so; 
* Demonstrate empathy by respecting the needs, views, and expectations of our colleagues, partners, and clients, contractors, vendors, as well as members of the general public who we might interact with in the course of our work;
* Recognize that differing social and cultural standards may mean that behavior that is acceptable to some may be perceived as unacceptable or unreasonable to others;
* Abide by all applicable rules, regulations, policies and bylaws and address any dissatisfaction with, or violation of, policies and procedures through appropriate channels;
* Be a responsible steward of material and human assets to achieve excellence and innovation in the work we do, including respecting the property and personal interests of those around us; 
* Speak up if you see or hear something. Harassment in any form should not be tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are subject to potentially intimidating, hostile, offensive, or abusive behavior. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged;
* If we are in leadership positions, recognize that our actions set the tone for the rest of the organization. As such, model civility for others and clearly set the example of how employees will treat each other, hold individuals accountable for their behaviors, and be responsive to complaints when they are brought forward.

## Policy against workplace harassment

Open Way Learning's commitment to a Respectful Workplace also extends with the recognition and acknowledgment that sexual harassment and other types of discriminatory harassment are, of course, unlawful. To reinforce this commitment, Open Way Learning has an open door policy against harassment and reporting goes directly to the Board Chair in any case where employees have been subjected to or witnessed harassment. This policy applies to all work‐related settings and activities, whether inside or outside the workplace, and includes work-related trips and social events. Specifically, we do not tolerate harassment against any individual at any formal or informal, live or remote work gathering or event, including, but not limited to: 

* Talks
* Forums
* Workshops
* Coaching Sessions
* Social media (or other online media), including personal accounts
* Parties
* Hallway conversations
* Booths and other similar activities
* Virtual Environments
* Electronic communication—via Slack, email, or event apps

While it is not possible to list all of the circumstances which would constitute sexual harassment, the following are some examples: (1) unwelcome sexual advances ‐‐ whether they involve physical touching or not; (2) requests for sexual favors in exchange for actual or promised job benefits such as favorable reviews, salary increases, promotions, increased benefits, or continued employment; (3) coerced sexual acts; or (4) (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an employee’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating, or offensive working environment. 

Depending on the circumstances, the following conduct may also constitute sexual harassment: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or any other protected category; sexual imagery in workplaces such as sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons (including what might be visible in a virtual meeting); deliberate intimidation; harassing photography or recording; unwelcome leering, whistling, deliberate brushing against the body in a suggestive manner; offensive verbal language; sexual gestures or sexually suggestive comments; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention, including stalking or following; inquiries into one’s sexual experiences; discussion of one’s sexual activities, and the use of and any other illegal activity not already covered above. 

While some of the above examples, depending on the circumstances, may not be severe or pervasive enough to create a sexually hostile work environment, they can nonetheless make co‐workers uncomfortable. Accordingly, such behavior is inappropriate and may result in disciplinary action regardless of whether it is unlawful. 

If you believe that you have experienced or witnessed sexual harassment or other discriminatory harassment by any Open Way Learning team member, you should report the incident immediately to your manager or to the Board Chair. Possible harassment by others with whom Open Way Learning has a business relationship, including customers and vendors, should also be reported as soon as possible so that appropriate action can be taken. 

The Board will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of harassment as discreetly and confidentially as practicable. The investigation would generally include a private interview with the person making a report of harassment. It would also generally be necessary to discuss allegations of harassment with the accused individual and others who may have information relevant to the investigation. 

The Board’s goal is to conduct a thorough investigation, to determine whether harassment occurred, and to determine what action to take if it is determined that improper behavior occurred. If the Board determines that a violation of this policy has occurred, it will take appropriate disciplinary action against the offending party, which can include counseling, warnings, suspensions, and termination. Employees who report violations of this policy and employees who cooperate with investigations into alleged violations of this policy will not be subject to retaliation.

Upon completion of the investigation, Open Way Learning will inform the employee who made the complaint of the results of the investigation. Note that it is unlawful and expressly against Open Way Learning policy to retaliate against an employee for filing a complaint of sexual harassment or for cooperating with an investigation of a complaint of sexual harassment.

Compliance with this policy is a condition of each employee’s employment. Employees are encouraged to raise any questions or concerns about this policy or about possible discriminatory harassment with the President or Chief Operations Officer. Note that in addition to this policy, employees should also be aware that the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) investigates and, in appropriate cases, prosecutes complaints of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation in employment. The EEOC, after a hearing, awards damages to individuals actually injured as a result of such conduct, as well as other remedies. Information about the EEOC complaint procedure can be found on its website (www.eeoc.gov), or by calling 1-800-669-4000 (English), or 1-800-669-6820 (TTY).

## Whistleblower policy
Employees have the right to report, without suffering retaliation, any activity by Open Way Learning or any of its employees that the employee reasonably believes: 1) violates any state or federal law; 2) violates or amounts to noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation; 3) violates fiduciary responsibilities by a nonprofit corporation, 4) or violates any for of this Code. In addition, employees can refuse to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of state or federal statutes, or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation.

Employees are also protected from retaliation for having exercised any of these rights in any former employment. The whistleblower protection laws do not entitle employees to violate a confidential privilege of the organization.

Any employee who suspects a problem with legal compliance is required to report the situation(s) to the Board Chair or any Board member (contact information found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B4OSl0HHguTf9Y0JhnTwXKSO-vRAQmtpJwTWo6Wi3Vo/edit?usp=sharing)). Employees may also report information regarding possible unlawful activity to an appropriate government or law enforcement agency.

## Compliance with all laws, rules and regulations
OWL will comply with all laws and governmental regulations that are applicable to its activities and expects all employees to obey the law. Laws can be complex and at times, even counterintuitive. Although it’s impossible to know all aspects of every law, you should understand the major laws, rules and regulations that apply to your work. You should consult with our COO if you are unsure or have any questions or concerns related to your work. A few specific areas of legal compliance are discussed in greater detail below:

* **Insider Trading**: As a nonprofit, OWL is not a publicly traded company. Nevertheless, because we believe firmly in transparency and trust across the organization, you may find yourself in possession of material nonpublic information, positive or negative, about other organizations with which we work, including confidential information about our clients, partners or other third parties. You may never buy or sell securities based on such inside information, nor can you tip off others to do so. It doesn’t matter how you learned the information—using material nonpublic information to trade securities is never acceptable. Doing so violates the law and the trust we have built with our fellow employees, and with our clients, partners, donors, and others.
* **No Bribery or Corruption:** All forms of bribery and corruption are prohibited. We will not tolerate bribery or corruption in any form or for any purpose. There is no potential benefit that can justify damaging our integrity and reputation or the trust others place in us. All persons subject to this Code must comply fully with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other applicable laws that prohibit bribery and corruption. Many of these laws are very broad and apply to both government and private bribery and corruption. If you have a question regarding any gift, entertainment or other expense, consult with our COO before you incur or authorize the expense.
* **Fair Sales and Marketing Practices:** We compete for contracts based solely on the merits of our services. We do not participate in any activities that unfairly harm other organizations, including ones that might be deemed as being in direct competition with OWL. We want to win contracts, but win them fairly. We will accurately represent OWL and our services in our marketing materials and any other public-facing information. Deliberately providing misleading messages or leaving out important facts or false claims about our products and services is inconsistent with our policies regarding trust and transparency.

## Fair dealing
All employees are required to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with clients, partners, competitors and other third parties. As an organization, we:

* prohibit bribes, kickbacks or any other form of improper payment, direct or indirect, to any representative of a government, labor union, client or vendor in order to obtain a contract, some other commercial benefit or government action;
* prohibit employees from accepting any bribe, kickback or improper payment from anyone;
* prohibit gifts or favors to or from any client or vendor, except for promotional material of nominal value and gifts of modest value (\<$50) that are related to commonly recognized events or occasions;
* limit marketing and client entertainment expenditures to those that are necessary, prudent, job related and consistent with our travel policy and this Code;
* require clear and precise communication in our contracts, advertising, literature and other public statements and seek to eliminate misstatement of fact or misleading impressions;
* reflect accurately on all invoices to clients the price and terms of sale for services rendered;
* protect all confidential data our clients, partners or vendors provide to us as reflected in our agreements with them or as compelled by law; and 
* prohibit our representatives from otherwise taking unfair advantage of our clients, partners or vendors, or other third parties, through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information or any other unfair-dealing practice.

## Conflict of interest and outside employment
OWL recognizes and respects employees' rights to engage in outside activities that they may deem proper and desirable, provided that these activities do not impair or interfere with the performance of their duties to OWL or their ability to act in OWL’s best interests. However, all employees must avoid situations in which their personal interests may conflict, or even appear to conflict, with the interests of OWL.

It is not possible to list every situation that might give rise to a conflict of interest, but the information that follows serves as a guide, pointing out important areas where conflicts may arise. The responsibility for conduct within the letter and the spirit of this Code regarding conflicts of interest rests with each individual. It is, however, important to avoid not only any situation that is an obvious conflict of interest, but also to be aware of situations that could be perceived by an impartial observer to be a conflict:

* In the absence of prior OWL approval, assets and property of OWL should be used for legitimate business purposes. All employees have an obligation to use OWL property efficiently and to report any theft or damage to OWL property to appropriate OWL management personnel. 
* Employees shall select and deal with vendors, clients, partners and other persons doing or seeking to do business with OWL in an impartial manner, without favor or preference based upon any considerations other than the best interests of OWL.
* Employees shall not seek or accept, directly or indirectly, any payments, fees, services, or loans from any person or business entity that does or seeks to do business with OWL. This does not, however, prohibit an employee from receiving compensation for outside services, when such outside services will not affect the impartial discharge of such person’s duties or obligations to OWL. 
* Employees shall not seek or accept for themselves, or any member of their families, any gifts, entertainment, or other favors of a character that goes beyond common courtesies consistent with ethical and accepted business practices and are consistent with our internal policies.
* Employees shall report any personal ownership interest or other relationship that might affect their ability to exercise impartial, ethical business judgments in their area of responsibility. Each situation reported shall be reviewed by the employee’s manager and/or COO, who will determine whether a conflict of interest exists or may arise from such a situation. 
* Employees shall not own, directly or indirectly, a financial interest (other than the ownership of less than 1.00% of the capital stock of a competitor whose common stock is publicly traded) in any business entity that is in direct competition with, or a significant financial interest in any business entity that does or seeks to do business with OWL, except where such interest has been fully disclosed to OWL and a determination has been made by OWL that such interest will not influence any decision that such person might be required to make performing duties for OWL.
* Employees shall also not accept a directorship or other managerial position in, or serve as a contractor or employee of, a business entity, organized for profit, that does or seeks to do business with, or is in competition with, OWL, without receiving specific approval from the COO.
* OWL employees will avoid conducting any direct business with a relative or significant other, or with a business with which you, a relative or significant other is significantly associated. To prevent a conflict of interest, employees directing business to or from OWL should discuss the situation with their manager and remove themselves from the decision-making process. Even if a related-party transaction appears to be in OWL’s best interests, you must first fully disclose the transaction to the COO and receive approval before engaging in that transaction. If you discover after the fact that we have done business with a related party, you must promptly report it to the COO (or if the COO is involved in the matter, the Chair of the Board will make this determination).
* Under SEC rules, OWL is not allowed to provide loans (or guarantee loans) to our officers, directors, or their family members.

All employees shall give OWL their fullest cooperation in the correction of any situation in which a conflict exists or may arise. Note that if a determination is made that the involvement in another organization presents an undue burden on the organization, the employee may be asked to resign from the other organization if they wish to remain in their role with OWL. All final decisions regarding conflict of interest are subject to approval by the Board of Directors.

## Substance abuse

OWL strives to maintain a workplace that is free from illegal use, possession, sale, or distribution of alcohol or controlled substances. Legal or illegal substances shall not be used in a manner that impairs a person’s performance of assigned tasks. This will help to maintain the efficient and effective operation of the business, and to ensure customers receive the proper service. OWL team members must also adhere to the local laws of where they reside and where they travel to, including any OWL sponsored event or other event, meal, or social gathering associated with client-facing work.

## Confidentiality and corporate assets

Even as an Open Source organization, employees are, on occasion, entrusted with OWL confidential information and with the confidential information of OWL vendors, clients or other business partners. This information may include: 

1. Technical or scientific information under development about current and future services or tools that has not been released to the public under a Creative Commons license; 
2. Business or marketing plans or projections; 
3. Internal financial data; 
4. Personnel information; 
5. Client lists; and 
6. Other non-public information that, if disclosed, might be of use to other organizations doing similar work, or harmful to OWL's vendors, clients or other partners.

All Board members, employees, staff, and volunteers will 100% maintain a sense of confidentiality regarding all items listed above, as well as any other aspects of operations, finances, human resources, and any other business of proprietary nature for the nonprofit. Moreover, any information that an employee learns about Open Way Learning, or its members or donors, as a result of working for Open Way Learning that is not otherwise publicly available constitutes confidential information. 

Discussions involving sensitive information should always be held in confidential settings to safeguard the confidentiality of the information. The President, COO, and Board Chair will be responsible for deciding what of this type of information will be made public on a case-by-case basis. Anyone working on public relations or grant writing will work closely with the COO in determining what required information can be made public. 

All employees, upon signing this Code of Ethics, agree to the following statement:

> I will not use or disclose Confidential Information, whether before, during or after the period of my association with Open Way Learning except to perform my duties as an employee or contractor, based on my reasonable judgment, or in accordance with instruction or authorization of my manager, without prior written consent from the Chief Operations Officer.

Strict adherence to the Confidentiality Agreement is required of each employee. Any employee who discloses confidential Open Way Learning information will be subject to disciplinary action (including possible separation), even if he or she does not actually benefit from the disclosure of such information. 

## Internet use policy 

This section sets forth some important rules relating to the use of Open Way Learning’s informational technology (IT), including computers (PCs provided to employees), communications systems, all associated software, and cell phones, voice mail, and electronic mail systems. OWL has provided and manages these systems to support its mission and although limited personal use of OWLs systems is allowed, no use of these systems should ever conflict with the primary purpose for which they have been provided. Note that by using any OWL IT, app, technology platform, device, sign-on, or email address, the employee acknowledges that they represent OWL and agrees to comply with this Internet Use Policy. 

All data in OWL’s computer and communication systems (including documents, other electronic files, e‐mail and recorded voicemail messages) are the property of Open Way Learning. OWL may inspect and monitor such data at any time. No individual should have any expectation of privacy for messages or other data recorded in OWL’s systems or hardware. This includes documents or messages marked “private,” which may be inaccessible to most users but remain available to OWL. Likewise, the deletion of a document or message may not prevent access to the item or completely eliminate the item from the system.

Open Way Learning’s systems must not be used to create or transmit material that is derogatory, defamatory, obscene or offensive, such as slurs, epithets or anything that might be construed as harassment or disparagement based on race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental disability, medical condition, marital status, or religious or political beliefs. Specifically, no employee is allowed to use the OWL information technology at ANY time for ANY activity pertaining to a sexual nature, including, but not limited to pornography, innuendo, re-posting memes of such a nature, as well as personal correspondence relating to sexual issues. Anyone found to use the OWL IT for any activity which is forbidden by the nonprofit will be asked to immediately leave. If child pornography or any illegal use has been found, law enforcement will be notified.

Similarly, OWL's information systems must not be used to solicit or proselytize others for commercial purposes, causes, outside organizations, chain messages or other non‐job‐related purposes.

## Social media policy

The social media landscape is rapidly changing and obviously affects the way we work,the way we communicate, and the way we project our brand. This offers us new opportunities to engage with clients, colleagues, and the world at large, but also provides some risks that have to be appropriately managed. The following are the official guidelines for how we should use social media in OWL’s work.

First of all, know that participation in social media on behalf of OWL is not a right but an opportunity, so please treat it seriously and with respect. If you want to participate on behalf of OWL, check with your Manager, colleagues, and/or the COO to understand the overall direction and tone of our focus and message to our clients, colleagues, and the world at large. You are also expected to know and follow the terms and conditions for any third-party sites, especially when working in schools and districts and particularly when posting anything related to student images or work.

Rules of Thumb:

* Always be transparent: Use your real name, identify that you work for OWL, and be clear about your role with the organization.
* Be yourself: Stick to your area of expertise and only write what you know. If you publish to a website outside of OWL, please use a disclaimer something like, "The postings on this site are my own and don’t necessarily reflect the views of OWL."
* Protect the organization’s reputation and brand: Be sure your transparency does not violate OWL policies or image. Remember, if you are online and are on the record—i.e. everything on the Internet is public and searchable.
* Never reveal OWL confidential information. If it gives you pause, then pause rather than publish.
* Don’t slam other organizations, our clients, partners, or OWL: Play nice. Anything you publish must be factual and never misleading or based on assumptions. All claims must be substantiated and if in doubt, approved before they are posted.
* Don’t over share: Remember that once you hit "share," you usually can’t get it back. Plus, being judicious will help make your content more crisp and audience-relevant.
* Follow copyright and fair use laws: For your protection as well as OWL’s you must comply with all laws governing copyright and fair use of copyrighted material owned by others. This means, for example, that you may not publish copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner, whether that is OWL or a third party.
* Use Common Sense: Perception is reality and in online social networks, the lines between public and private, personal and professional are blurred. Just by identifying yourself as an OWL employee, you are creating perceptions about your expertise and about OWL. 
* Add value: There are millions of words out there—make yours helpful and thought-provoking!
* Keep it cool: There can be a fine line between healthy debate and incendiary reaction. Try to frame what you write to invite differing points of view without inflaming others. Be careful and considerate.

To summarize, when you use Social Media, use good judgment. Be aware that there may be consequences to what you post or publish online. These consequences may include discipline up to and including dismissal if the conduct violates this policy or if OWL determines that your posting or publication is not legally protected and harms (or has the potential to harm) OWL’ legitimate business interests and obligations towards its employees and clients. Also note that this policy is not intended to infringe in any way on OWL employees’ legal rights to discuss the terms and conditions of their employment with other OWL employees for their mutual aid and benefit. 

## Financial matters

You are expected to act responsibly and exercise sound judgment with respect to our finances and financial reporting. OWL’s stakeholders, including the Board, clients, and donors, rely on accurate and fair financial information to understand our financial results and make informed decisions. You also are expected to record and report all financial transactions honestly and accurately, to comply with our system of internal controls and to follow applicable laws, regulations and accounting practices.

We regularly file reports and other documents with regulatory authorities, including an annual 990 form with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In addition, we may make other public communications, such as press releases, from time to time. Depending upon your position with the nonprofit, you may be called upon to provide information to help ensure that our public reports and communications are complete, fair, accurate and understandable. You are expected to use all reasonable efforts to provide complete, accurate, objective, relevant, timely and understandable answers to inquiries related to our public disclosures. 

Employees involved in preparing public reports and communications must use all reasonable efforts to comply with our disclosure controls and procedures. If you believe that any disclosure is materially misleading or if you become aware of any material information that you believe should be disclosed to the public, it is your responsibility to bring this information to the attention of our COO. If you believe that questionable accounting or auditing conduct or practices have occurred or are occurring, you should follow the procedures set forth in the Whistleblower Policy listed below. 

Our periodic reports and other documents filed with the IRS, including all financial statements and other financial information, must comply with applicable federal securities laws, and IRS regulations. If you contribute in any way to the preparation or verification of our financial statements and other financial information, you must ensure that our books, records and accounts are accurately maintained. You must also cooperate fully with our finance department, as well as our independent public accountants and counsel. 

Refer to Appendix B for additional information related to OWL's financial obligations.

## Business expenses

You are expected to incur business expenses wisely. When you submit an expense for reimbursement or spend money on OWL’s behalf, you must make sure that the cost is reasonable, directly related to our business, supported by appropriate documentation and in compliance with our internal policies. Always submit expense reports in a timely manner, record the business purpose and relevant details and comply with all submission requirements. If you are uncertain about whether you should spend money or submit an expense for reimbursement, check with your manager.

Managers are responsible for all money spent and expenses incurred by their direct reports and should carefully review such expenses and supporting receipts before approving.

Note that the Directors, Board Members, and any Finance Department personnel bear a special responsibility for promoting integrity throughout the organization, with responsibilities to stakeholders both inside and outside of OWL. These persons have a special role not only to adhere to these principles themselves but also to ensure that a culture exists throughout OWL as a whole that ensures the fair, accurate, comprehensive and timely reporting of financial results. Because of this special role, the Chief Innovation Officer, Chief Operations Officer, all Finance Department personnel, and all other employees, must:

* act with honesty and integrity, avoiding actual or apparent conflicts of interest in personal and professional relationships;  
* provide information that is accurate, complete, objective, timely and understandable to ensure full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that OWL files with, or submits to, government agencies and in other public communications;
* comply with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations, and acquire appropriate knowledge of such laws, rules and regulations relating to OWL' duties sufficient to enable the employee to recognize potential dangers and to know when to seek legal advice;
* promptly report to the COO and/or the Board Chair any conduct believed to be a violation of law or business ethics or of any provision of this Code, including any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such a conflict; and   
* promote accountability to this Code among all employees.

Refer to Appendix B for additional information related to the proper handling of expenses.

## Inviolable standards of conduct

For violation of any of the following rules of conduct, an employee shall be subject to penalties ranging from a formal written warning notice up to, and including, discharge.

* Chronic neglect of duty.
* Immoral or indecent conduct.
* Conviction of a felony.
* Violation of local, state, or federal law which causes unfavorable publicity to OWL, impairs the credibility of the employee to perform the employee's job or is otherwise connected to employment.
* Intentional falsification of personnel records, payroll reports or other OWL records.
* Deliberate or careless conduct endangering the safety of self or other employees, including the provocation or instigation of violence.  
* Consuming alcoholic beverages while on duty, except at approved functions, or the possession or consumption of illegal drugs.
* Possession of a weapon, or any item that can be used as a weapon while on company business outside one’s home. 
* Abusive, threatening or coercive treatment of another employee or member of the public.  
* Breach of confidentiality. 
* Using or appearing to use for personal gain any information obtained on the job, which is not readily available to the general public or disclosing such information that damages the interests of Open Way Learning or its clients.
* For other offenses of equal magnitude to the above.

Violations of this Code, regardless of whether an actual law has been violated, will not be tolerated. OWL will promptly, thoroughly and fairly investigate every issue that is brought to its attention and will take disciplinary action, when appropriate, up to and including termination of employment. Violations of the Code are typically handled in the following manner, depending on the severity of the violation:

1. Verbal warning. Verbal statement to the employee that they have violated a rule and/or regulation and that such violation may not continue.
2. Written reprimand. Formal notification in writing to the employee that they have violated a rule and/or regulation.
3. Suspension. Loss of work and wages for a specific number of hours or days, but not for more than one work week, depending on the severity of the offense. Notice of suspension is provided to the employee in writing.  
4. Discharge. The employer/employee relationship is severed.

## Company credit cards

OWL provides some employees whose job responsibilities require frequent business travel or purchasing on behalf of OWL access to an AMEX corporate credit card. This is a privilege and not a right and employees who have such cards are responsible for the following requirements:

* Knowing and abiding by all the terms of use specified in the credit card contract, including knowing and operating within the specified credit limits, complying with all fraud-protection services, and ensuring payments for all expenses are made prior to any applicable deadlines.
* Managing their activities to ensure they maintain full access to the card while traveling. 
* Contacting the credit card company in advance of any international travel.  
* Configuring alerts to ensure they receive direct notification when fraud alerts are triggered.   
* Immediately informing AMEX of a lost or stolen card, or suspected fraudulent transactions. 
* The OWL corporate card is only authorized for business-related expenses. Any personal expenses charged in error to the business card must be reimbursed to OWL as soon as possible.   
* Major expenses of \>$1000 should be pre-approved by the employee’s manager or COO to ensure budget controls are maintained.  

All cardholders are responsible for reconciling their credit card activity and making receipts available for review by their manager (or the COO) for each transaction at the end of each month, prior to when payment is due. If an employee is significantly delinquent in this reconciliation process, the credit card privilege may be revoked.

## OWL property

Employees are responsible for all OWL equipment, property, and work products that may be issued to them and/or are in their possession or control, including but not limited to: 

* Credit cards, 
* Office or company car keys,
* Computers and email/voice mail codes
* Intellectual property (e.g., written materials, work products, etc.) 

## Separation

Under certain circumstances, the termination or lay‐off of one or more employees may be necessary. These employees are eligible for severance pay if on the date of their separation is more than one year of continuous service. In these cases, the employee will receive one full week of severance, at their base pay (less deductions permitted or required by law) for each full year of continuous service with Open Way Learning, for up to a maximum of 52 weeks of total severance pay.

In the event of separation from employment, or immediately upon request by the COO or his or her designee, employees must return all Open Way Learning property that is in their possession or control.  Where permitted by applicable law(s), Open Way Learning may withhold from the employeeʹs final paycheck the cost of any property, including intellectual property, which is not returned when required. Open Way Learning also may take any action deemed appropriate to recover or protect its property. 

Note that either Open Way Learning or the employee may initiate separation. Open Way Learning encourages employees to provide at least two weeks (10 days) written notice prior to intended resignation. After receiving such notice, an exit interview will be scheduled by the President or their designee. The purpose of the exit interview is to complete necessary forms, collect company property and discuss employment experiences with the company.

## Questions, reporting and effect of violations

Compliance with this Code is, first and foremost, the individual responsibility of every employee. OWL attempts to foster an open, safe, and transparent work environment in which ethical issues and concerns may be raised and discussed with any other team member or Board member without fear of retribution. 

If an employee is aware of a suspected or actual violation of this Code by others, they have a responsibility to report it to leadership. The employee and OWL will be best served by bringing the concern into the open so that any problems can be resolved quickly, and more serious harm is prevented. OWL will not allow any retaliation against any employee who acts in good faith in reporting any violation of this Code or against any person who is assisting in good faith in any investigation or process with respect to such a report. Any employee who participates in any such retaliation is subject to disciplinary action, including termination.

Generally, each employee’s direct manager will be in the best position to quickly resolve any questions about the Code or potential violations. If after raising an issue regarding the Code it remains unresolved, the employee is encouraged to raise it with OWL’s COO or Board Chair. Note that employees can raise their concerns orally or in writing and while OWL prefers that each employee gives his or her name and other pertinent information to help make the investigation and resolution of the suspected violations being reported more effective and efficient, the employees may also make a report anonymously.

## Administration, waiver, and amendment

The OWL Board is ultimately responsible for establishing the standards of business conduct contained in this Code. The OWL Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility for administering and interpreting the Code to the COO. The COO and their authorized delegates are responsible for administering this Code by overseeing compliance. While serving in this capacity, the COO reports directly to the OWL Board.

Any waiver of any provision of the Code for the benefit of a director or officer (which includes without limitation, for purposes of the Code, OWL’s principal executive and financial officers), shall be effective only if approved by the Board in its sole discretion. Any waivers of the Code for other employees may be made by the COO.

OWL is committed to continuously reviewing and updating our policies and procedures. Therefore, this Code is subject to modification. Any amendment of this Code must be approved by the OWL Board and will be promptly communicated to all employees. Moreover, any amendments or waiver may also be publicly disclosed, if required by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

## Appendix A: Records retention policy

The American Competitiveness and Corporate Accountability Act of 2002, commonly known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, was signed into law on July 30, 2002. The Act was passed in response to several corporate scandals and was intended to rebuild public trust in the corporate sector. Although most provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley apply only to public companies, at least two criminal provisions apply to nonprofit organizations: provisions prohibiting retaliation against whistleblowers and prohibiting the destruction, alteration or concealment of certain documents or the impediment of investigations. This section of the WOL Code of Conduct & Ethics applies specifically to the latter (refer to the Whistleblower Section above for details regarding the former). 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 forbids purging of documents when any organization – nonprofit or for-profit – is under federal investigation. In short, it is a federal crime to alter, cover up, falsify, or destroy any document to prevent its use in an official proceeding. This Records Retention Policy ensures compliance with these requirements, as well as promotes and assists with the implementation of procedures, best practices, and tools to promote consistent life cycle management of OWL records. 

Because records contain important information, it is essential to take a systematic approach to the management of such records. As such, OWL takes seriously its obligations to preserve information relating to litigation, audits, and investigations. Failure on the part of employees to follow this policy can result in possible civil and criminal sanctions against the Nonprofit and its employees, Board members, and Directors, as well as disciplinary action against responsible individuals, up to and including termination of employment. However, record retention does not mean permanent retention. The unnecessary retention of records creates significant burdens for OWL, including taking up valuable storage space and making retrieval of needed records more difficult and costly. 

This policy is used as the basis for determining when destruction of records is required per record type, as listed in the OWL Records Retention Schedule listed below, and is to be followed except in those instances where the OWL Board directs otherwise (such as when a Litigation Hold is issued by the Board Chair). When the retention period for a particular record expires, it should be immediately destroyed or deleted. 

The OWL Records Retention Policy is based on a fundamental distinction between a "record" and a "non-record." This policy applies only to “records” per the definition below: 

* A “record” is a document created or received by OWL in the transaction of business and contains significant business value. The business value of a record is derived from the legal, regulatory, fiscal, operational, or informational significance of the content. 
* “Document” is defined as a piece of written, printed, or electronic matter that provides information or evidence or otherwise serves as an official record. It includes, but is not limited to software applications, files, paper, presentations, spreadsheets, electronic images or drawings, pictures, and emails. 
* A “non-record” is everything that does not qualify as a “record.” Non-records are materials that OWL does not own, materials without substantive business value, or materials that have only temporary use as reference or reminders. They are not subject to OWL Records Retention Schedule and should be discarded when no longer needed. Examples of non-records include correspondence that is only needed for a short period of time and does not have substantive business value; calendars; informational items such as publications and extra copies of documents kept only for convenience or reference; personal or casual correspondence; reminders that are needed only for a short period of time and do not have substantive business value. 
* A copy of a record is typically a duplicate that was created for dissemination or handy reference. There is no obligation to retain copies. Copies may be disposed of when they are no longer needed.

For the purpose of this policy, “records” must be retained throughout their life cycle in accordance with OWL Records Retention Schedule listed below. Specifically, all OWL employees are responsible for making and keeping records of their work per four basic obligations: 

1. Create the minimum essential records they need to meet their specific role and responsibilities for the business of OWL, including recording decisions on actions taken and documenting activities for which they are responsible.  
2. Maintain records in a legible and readily identifiable format.
3. Take care of records so that information can be found when needed. This means setting up adequate electronic files and folders, as well as filing materials regularly and carefully in a manner that allows them to be safely stored and efficiently retrieved, if necessary.
4. Carry out the destruction or retention of records under their control per the OWL Records Retention Schedule listed below. This includes verifying records are destroyed in a manner conducive to prevent the release of sensitive information into the public domain (i.e. erasing, shredding, etc.).

Note that electronic recordkeeping systems must be designed to ensure the security and integrity of the records, preservation of records for the time when they are needed, and migration of data to other OWL systems as needed. Consequently, OWL records should not be maintained solely on a personal hard drive or flash drive. OWL employees should transfer such electronic records to the secure electronic filing system located in the OWL Google Shared Drive, placed in applicable folders that are labeled for appropriate access by other OWL employees. This should be done as soon as possible after such records are created.

OWL strongly discourages the storage of voluminous non-record email messages because of the limited value of such messages, and the cost and confusion associated with unmanaged retention and proliferation of email. Unmanaged retention of such messages can potentially lead to an inaccurate history of OWL because of its haphazard and incomplete nature. As a general rule, employees are encouraged to promptly delete any non-record email messages they send or receive that no longer require action and are no longer necessary to OWL’s business. If a non-record email no longer has business value, it should be deleted.

OWL employees are discouraged from printing or creating hard copies of confidential or proprietary documents or records. If creating hard copies is unavoidable, employees must properly dispose of hard copy records by shredding them and/or otherwise rendering the documents unusable or unreadable. If they are printed and kept for a short-term time period, they must be stored in a secure location until they are no longer needed and can be destroyed.

The following are additional criteria that must be followed for all OWL Records: 

* The retention periods specified in OWL Records Retention Schedule applies to the "original" version (i.e. the official record). Copies of records should be destroyed when they are no longer needed.  
* Storage of records will be in such a form as to preserve the integrity of the record so that it cannot be tampered with or altered without authorized approval to do so.  
* Litigation Holds or other non-destruct directives issued by OWL’s Board Chair override any destruction authority granted by the Records Retention Schedule. In addition, destruction of non-record materials identified in the Litigation Hold is suspended.

| Type of Document | Minimum Requirement |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Accounts payable ledgers and schedules | 7 years |
| Background check results | 6 years |
| Bank Statements and Reconciliations | 3 years |
| Board minutes, Bylaws, Articles of Incorporation, and other governance documents | Permanently |
| Contracts | Contract period |
| Copies of Checks  | Permanently |
| Deeds, mortgages, and bills of sale | Permanently |
| Depreciation schedules | Permanently |
| Duplicate deposit slips | 3 years |
| Employment applications | 3 years |
| Insurance records, current accident reports, claims, policies, and so on (active and expired) | Permanently |
| Internal and External Audit reports | Permanently |
| Invoices (to customers, from vendors) | 7 years |
| Job roles and responsibilities | 3 years |
| Legal Correspondence  | Permanently |
| On-boarding documentation | 2 years |
| Payroll records and summaries | 7 years |
| Personnel files and records for any terminated employees | 7 years |
| Tax filings or statements (e.g. 990 forms) | Permanently |
| Timesheets | 7 years |
| Year-end financial statements | Permanently |

To ensure the organization operates in a manner consistent with this policy, an annual review of the record retention requirements and procedures will be conducted by the COO (or by their qualified designee). 

## Appendix B: Board of Directors code of ethics

This document acts as a supplement to the above general Code of Ethics and is applicable only to the Open Way Learning Board of Directors. It establishes additional principles and practices of the Board of Directors so that they can set parameters and provide guidance and direction for board conduct and decision-making.

### Section 1: Overview 

OWL's Board of Directors has ultimate operational and financial oversight of all property, business, and affairs of Open Way Learning. As such, Board Members will exercise a duty of care that governs the attention and judgment required in fulfilling all Board related obligations; a duty of loyalty that relates to any personal interest that might conflict with the nonprofit’s interests; and a duty of obedience to ensure compliance with the nonprofit’s governing principles as contained in this document, its ByLaws, and Articles of Incorporation. 

Moreover, members of the Board of Directors of Open Way Learning are committed to observing and promoting the highest standards of ethical conduct in the performance of their responsibilities on the board of Open Way Learning. Board members pledge to accept this code as a minimum guideline for ethical conduct and shall:

1. Faithfully abide by the Articles of Incorporation, ByLaws, and policies of Open Way Learning.  
2. Exercise reasonable care, good faith and due diligence in organizational affairs.  
3. Fully disclose, at the earliest opportunity, information that may result in a perceived conflict of interest.  
4. Fully disclose, at the earliest opportunity, information of fact that would have significance in board decision-making.  
5. Remain accountable for prudent fiscal management to association members, the board, and nonprofit sector, and where applicable, to government and funding bodies.  
6. Maintain a professional level of courtesy, respect, and objectivity in all Open Way Learning activities.  
7. Strive to uphold those practices and assist other Open Way Learning members of the board in upholding the highest standards of conduct.  
8. Exercise the powers invested for the good of all members of the organization rather than for his or her personal benefit, or that of the nonprofit they represent.  
9. Ensure the right of all association members to appropriate and effective services without discrimination on the basis of geography, political, religious, or socio-economic characteristics of the state or region represented.  
10. Ensure the right of all association members to appropriate and effective services without discrimination on the basis of the organization’s volunteer or staff make-up in respect to gender, sexual orientation, national origin, race, religion, age, political affiliation or disability, in accordance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  
11. Respect the confidentiality of sensitive information known due to board service.  
12. Respect the diversity of opinions as expressed or acted upon by the Open Way Learning board, committees and membership, and formally register dissent as appropriate.  
13. Promote collaboration, cooperation, and partnership among association members.

### Section 2: Board of Directors conflict of interest policy

The conflict of interest policy is intended to protect the nonprofit when it contemplates  
entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of a director of the nonprofit or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy supplements but does not replace applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.

#### Definitions

   1. Interested Person: Any director with a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.  
   2. Financial Interest. A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:  
      1. an ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the nonprofit has a transaction or arrangement.  
      2. a compensation arrangement with the nonprofit or with any entity or individual with which the nonprofit has a transaction or arrangement, or   
      3. a potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation\* arrangement with any entity or individual with which the nonprofit is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.   

{% hint style="info" %}
Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial. A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. A person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the board of directors decides that a conflict of interest exists.
{% endhint %}

#### Procedures
     
   1. Duty to Disclose. In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.  
   2. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he or she shall leave the board of directors meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.  
   3. Procedures For Addressing the Conflict Of Interest.  
      1. An interested person may make a presentation at the board of directors meeting, but after the presentation, he or she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.  
      2. The chair of the board of directors, if appropriate, shall appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.  
      3. After exercising due diligence, the board of directors shall determine whether the nonprofit can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.  
      4. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the board of directors shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the nonprofit’s best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination, it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.  
   4. Violations Of The Conflicts Of Interest Policy.  
      1. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.  
      2. If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the board of directors determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.  
           
#### Records of proceedings
     
   1. The minutes of the board of directors shall contain:  
      1. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the board of directors decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.  
      2. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings.  
           
#### Compensation
A voting member of the board of directors who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the nonprofit for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member’s compensation. Any director whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the nonprofit, either individually or collectively, is prohibited from providing information to any committee regarding compensation.  
     
#### Annual statements.
Each director shall annually sign [this statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-Z8e9J9KDFhgLnIar_4v1kt7PdhFzBZuFrVQVKBgTk/edit?usp=sharing), which affirms such person:  

   1. Has received a copy of this conflicts of interest policy,   
   2. Has read and understands the policy,  
   3. Has agreed to comply with the policy, and  
   4. Understands the nonprofit is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.  
        
#### Periodic reviews
To ensure the nonprofit operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:  

   1. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm’s length bargaining.   
   2. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the nonprofit’s written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in injurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit transaction.  
        
#### Use of outside experts
When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in section 6 of this policy, the nonprofit may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.

### Section 3: Performance evaluation
To ensure OWL’s short and long term obligations are being met consistent with its mission and vision, there will be a variety of on-going evaluations at the board and director level. Board members should evaluate their collective and individual performance at least once every three years and discuss any potential issues as an entire board. Likewise, all OWL Directors (and other higher compensated employees and consultants) are subject to an annual evaluation from the Board per the “Performance Evaluation” of the [Employee Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rs3qNf9kyUbKtqZVawR6pAHgAD2xsmgxRU2GZuUOFC8/edit?usp=sharing). 

### Section 4: Financial oversight
All financial statements will conform to generally accepted accounting principles, including the safeguarding of assets, compliance with expectations and legal requirements of grantors and donors, and the accurate, efficient, and transparent management of all finances. All nonprofit staff with a role in the management of fiscal and accounting operations are expected to comply with the policies and procedures in this manual.

### Section 5: Full time employee & director base pay

The Directors (President and COO) of the nonprofit are ultimately responsible for its efficient operation per its annual strategic goals and within constraints such as its operating budget. Likewise, the organization is deeply committed to the ideals of the open source movement, including favoring a philosophy of distributed leadership, where everyone in the organization is empowered to individually and collectively further the nonprofit’s mission (as opposed to a traditional, hierarchical structure of being told what to do and when to do it). As such, it is the desire of the Board to provide a fair, yet reasonable compensation package (base pay, benefits, and bonus pay) for all salaried, full time, exempt employees so that it can attract and retain the talent needed to best accomplish this responsibility. 

The annual process for reviewing the compensation options for full time exempt employees\* and the specific compensation package for each of OWL’s Directors is done by the Board, informed through a comprehensive model that has been developed per the core values of the organization, including the attributes mentioned above. Specifically, this model (found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-hAluZmtizIDmvgUqz2F_zidfc7lKHQrFDJS3BE5qwU/edit?usp=sharing) \- reference the first tab) includes the following components:

* An available amount for exempt salaries is pulled directly from the projected fiscal year budget and accounts for the total number of full time, exempt employees.  
* The Board can make adjustments for the percent of total budget dedicated to overall salaries (from a minimum of 30% to a maximum of 75%), as well as the percentage that will be dedicated to part time and non-exempt roles.  
* Base pay for all OWL exempt employees starts with an average of what is available per the above criteria, one’s prior annual salary, and the mean annual salary of a high school teacher (pro-rated for 12 months). This is to ensure the organization stays grounded to the pay of our primary customer, teachers. Note that this mean salary can also be adjusted for geographic location in a case where state pay is significantly greater than the country mean.  
* Base pay is increased by years of organizational leadership experience (in or out of a school context) and advanced degrees. This new base pay is also then increased at a 3% per year of OWL service basis. This represents one’s final OWL base pay.   
* To honor the collective leadership ethos OWL wishes to cultivate across the organization, the final OWL base pay is increased by 5% if one is in an emerging leadership role (as opposed to a role of only providing client-facing workshops and coaching). The final OWL base pay is increased by 10% if one is in a Director role for the nonprofit.

Refer to the [OWL Employee Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rs3qNf9kyUbKtqZVawR6pAHgAD2xsmgxRU2GZuUOFC8/edit?usp=sharing) for a list of definitions such as full time, exempt, etc.

The above model and underlying structure ensures that all employee pay is reasonable and not excessive, completely transparent and fair, incentivized at the level of the entire organization's performance (vs. individual performance that can be subjective at best), and in recognition of one’s experience within and outside the organization. 

The Chair of the Board (who is a volunteer and not compensated by the Nonprofit) will lead the compensation analysis with the Treasurer. They will operate independently and without influence from employees or the Directors. Based on advice from the Chair, the Board will agree and approve the compensation structure for employees and the specific overall compensation for the nonprofit’s Directors at its annual meeting and as part of the Treasurer’s Report. This will include base pay and bonuses (refer to the section below for criteria regarding bonuses).

Documentation of the Board’s final decision regarding exempt employee and Director compensation will be made via the minutes of the annual meeting, including specific verification that each of the following points have been addressed to ensure full regulatory compliance:

1. The final decision regarding compensation has been made independently by the Board and as a result of arms' length bargaining;   
2. The total compensation packages are reasonable and include consideration such as employee specialty and geographic locale;   
3. The base pay includes a ceiling or reasonable maximum;   
4. The total amount of compensation does not have the potential to reduce the charitable services or benefits the organization would otherwise provide;   
5. The compensation packages include a means to account for measures of individual employee performance;   
6. The total compensation package keeps the organization within budget without charging more for services;   
7. The compensation structure does not transform the principal activity of the organization into a joint venture between it and the employee;   
8. The Director pay structure is not merely a device to distribute all or a portion of the organization's profits to persons who are in control of the organization;   
9. The compensation structure serves a real and discernable business purpose of the nonprofit;   
10. The compensation structure does not enable or result in abuse or unwarranted benefits; and   
11. The compensation structure rewards employees based on services they actually perform.

### Section 6: Deficit/surplus funds policy
As a nonprofit organization, Open Way Learning operates on the general assumption that it will end each fiscal year with a balanced budget \- i.e. its expenses will be offset and matched with its income from services and donations. Nevertheless, Board members should also realize that ‘nonprofits can’t make money’ is a myth that can become unnecessarily constricting in pursuit of the nonprofit’s overall mission. As such, rather than exclusively focusing on a balanced budget, OWL’s annual budgeting cycle will start with the premise of “*What financial outcome do we want or need this year in order to further our mission?*” Answering this question may lead to decisions by the Board that could include operating in a deficit or may lead to a year-end surplus.

If the Board determines that a deficit is needed, it must do so by knowing that the following criteria can be met: 

* The organization has enough cash and Operating Reserves on hand to meet all financial obligations (including determining that drawing from the Operating Reserve is a good idea \- see the section below for more details).   
* The time is right for the organization to make a short term investment that will have significant probability for financial payback (e.g. investing reserve funds to strengthen fundraising capacity, new programming, etc.).  
* Operating in a short term and reasonable deficit is a strategically sound fiduciary decision by the Board as a lesser evil than making rash decisions that could harm the long term viability of the organization (e.g. cutting staff, reducing salaries and wages, increasing prices for services, etc.).

If the Board determines that a deficit is not needed per the above criteria, then the budgeting process must be done in a good faith way to ensure that the organization can indeed break even, while meeting all its financial obligations in the full service of its mission as an education nonprofit (including payment of any debt, spending all restricted funds, etc.). This budgeting process is done by reviewing prior performance, projecting expenses and income over the next fiscal year, and anticipating reasonable scenarios that might increase or decrease costs or revenue, including increasing cash flow, creating surplus funds that can be used in the future, etc. Once a draft budget has been developed, it must be submitted to the Treasurer of the Board of Directors and then approved by the entire Board per the [OWL Bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gRFzIcK61wmyvrqAbDXfZSBSd8TetCBO2Wu5C4r84gg/edit?usp=sharing).

After a budget has been approved, the Board and Directors will ensure that it is communicated to all OWL employees as the basis for their exercising sound judgment regarding individual and collective performance goals, including realistic income targets and expenses. If the Board determines that the organization will be able to outperform approved budget projections and deliver a surplus of higher than expected net assets at the end of the year, it has the sole discretion to use the surplus in a way that the organization and its employees can enjoy the benefits of a stronger than expected financial position. The following criteria are provided as guidance for determining the most appropriate use of surplus funds (note that per Section 4 above, the Chair of the Board will oversee any determination regarding the use of surplus funds as bonus pay):

* Any restricted funds from a surplus must be explicitly earmarked for expenditure as required by the grant, donors, or other specifications that dictate how such funds must be spent. Records must be kept that prove how such funding was spent.  
* 10 to 90% of any year-end surplus (minus restricted funds mentioned above) may be used to increase the amount of Operating Reserves the organization has on hand. Note that if the Operating Reserve is below its target amount (see section below), then the Board, per advice from the Treasurer, may determine that a higher percentage of the surplus be directed toward Operating Reserves.  
* 10 to 90% of any year-end surplus (minus restricted funds mentioned above) may be used as bonuses that will be equally shared by all full time OWL employees\* in recognition of collective, exceptional performance in pursuit of the organization’s mission (e.g. by improving efficiency, the quality of our service, cost containment practices, etc.). Note that such bonuses are not to be assumed as automatic, will be capped at 20% of any individual’s base pay, and will be taxed at the same rate as an individual’s base pay. Also, under no circumstances will individuals soliciting charitable contributions for the nonprofit be compensated based on fundraising results.  
* The Board may exercise discretion regarding how any remaining percentage of a year end surplus is to be spent after addressing the above criteria. This can include, but is not limited to investments in capital assets, hardware, or software that helps the organization achieve its mission in a more efficient manner; “R\&D Travel,” such as school visits, education conferences, or field research; advanced professional development such as learning labs, leadership courses, fellowships, or other networked partnerships; or strategic investments or contributions to other charitable organizations that align with OWL’s mission and vision.   

All full-time OWL employees (including Directors and non-exempt employees) will be eligible to receive a bonus if they meet the following criteria (refer to the [OWL Employee Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rs3qNf9kyUbKtqZVawR6pAHgAD2xsmgxRU2GZuUOFC8/edit?usp=sharing) for a definition of Full Time Employee):

1. They were a full time employee as of July 1 of the year that the Board determines that a surplus will be used for bonus pay (defined as the Plan Year) and remained a full time employee through December 31 of the Plan Year.  
2. They receive a satisfactory year-end performance rating during the Plan Year.

### Section 7: Operating reserve
The Operating Reserve Fund is defined as a designated fund set aside by action of the Board of Directors to ensure the stability of the mission, programs, employment, and ongoing operations of the organization. The Operating Reserve is intended to provide an internal source of funds for situations such as a sudden increase in expenses, onetime unbudgeted expenses, unanticipated loss in funding, or uninsured losses. The Reserve may also be used for one-time, nonrecurring expenses that will build long-term capacity, such as staff development, research and development, or investment in infrastructure. Operating Reserves are not intended to replace a permanent loss of funds or eliminate an ongoing budget gap. It is the intention of Open Way Learning’s Operating Reserves to be used and replenished within a reasonably short period of time. 

The Operating Reserve is used at the discretion of the Board in concert with the other governance and financial policies of the Board and is intended to support the goals and strategies contained in the nonprofit’s strategic and operational plans.

The minimum target amount to be designated as Operating Reserve will be established by the Board as being an amount sufficient to maintain ongoing operations and programs for at least three months of average and normal operations. This Operating Reserve amount will be reviewed and adjusted by the Board in response to internal and external changes on an annual basis. The calculation of average monthly operating costs includes all recurring, predictable expenses such as salaries and benefits, office, travel, program, and ongoing professional services. Depreciation, in-kind, and other non-cash expenses are not included in the calculation. The calculation of average monthly expenses also excludes some expenses such as one-time or unusual expenses. The amount of the Operating Reserve Fund target minimum will be calculated each year after the development of a draft annual budget by the Board Treasurer and will be included in the regular financial reports to the full Board.

### Section 8: Fiscal year financial reports
At the fiscal year end, the COO will review all balance sheet accounts including verification of the following balances: cash accounts match the bank reconciliations, fixed assets accounts reflect all purchases, and accounts receivable and payable accounts match outstanding amounts due and owed. The income and expense accounts review will include reconciliation to amounts received and expended and verification that payroll expenses match the payroll reports including federal and state reporting requirements. Once the final fiscal year-end financial statements are run, reviewed, and approved by the COO, no more entries or adjustments will be made into that year’s ledgers.

At the end of the fiscal year, the President (or outside CPA) will prepare the annual Return for Organization Exempt from Income Tax (IRS Form 990). The return will be presented to the Board of Directors for their review and approval prior to submission. The President will then file the return with the Internal Revenue Service by the annual deadline. Because the nonprofit is listed with the North Carolina Center for Nonprofits, a copy of said 990 Return will be sent by the IRS to the nonprofit verifier and available for review by the public.

All other appropriate government filings including those required by the North Carolina state tax board and attorney general’s office will be completed by the COO and filed with the appropriate agency.

The COO will also prepare annual financial reports for distribution to the Treasurer of the Board prior to the Board’s Annual Meeting. The reports will include: balance sheet, statement of income and expenses, budget versus actual report for each program which has an established budget, a budget versus actual report for the organization, cash flow projection, and any other requested reports.

### Section 9: Other fiscal policy items

* All cash accounts owned by the nonprofit will be held in financial institutions which are insured by the FDIC. No bank account will carry a balance over the FDIC insured amount.  
* All capital expenditures which exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) will be capitalized.  
* No salary advances will be made under any circumstances. No travel cash advances will be made except under special conditions and pre-approved by the COO.  
* Any donated item with a value exceeding ($100) will be recorded and a letter acknowledging the donation will be sent to the donor within 30 days of the receipt of the donation. All volunteer time shall be recorded as in-kind donations.

### Section 10: Policy review

All Open Way Learning policies are subject to periodic review by the Board of Directors, including this document and all other policies and procedures. This review is done to ensure such policies have continued relevance and the organization’s compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and generally accepted best practices and may be initiated by any member of the Board of Directors.

Likewise, the Board of Directors will periodically review the adequacy of its directors and officers liability insurance policy, as well as other applicable insurance policies the nonprofit may have or need.

## Appendix C: State & federal labor & employment notices

Because Open Way Learning does not have typical brick and mortar offices, we don't have a physical worksite or break room wall upon which to post important labor and employment notices for team members. As such, [this summary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/labor-and-employment-notices/) from OWL (a similar “all remote” organization) provides such notices for each state. Likewise, [this document](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters) provides similar reference for US Federal Labor Law notices.

### Appendix D: Timekeeping policy

The purpose of this policy is to outline the timekeeping practices for all Open Way Learning employees. Accurately reporting time worked per specific contracts, grants, restricted donations, and government awards is the responsibility of every full and part time employee. Moreover, every nonexempt employee is required to keep an accurate record of total time worked to calculate employee pay and benefits. 

#### Exempt and nonexempt employee time tracking requirements:

* All time must be maintained and recorded by all exempt and nonexempt employees whose compensation in whole, or in part, is charged to specific client contracts, grants, restricted donations, or government awards.  
* The distribution of time related to personal time and activities related to the above sources must be done at least once per month via the [OWL Productive platform](https://app.productive.io/22109-open-way-learning/dashboard/widgets). Refer to [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p12MG6foZOEhwfNJv7qNtue9B8ora4Tj?usp=sharing) for a complete set of “Standard Operating Procedure” videos on how to track and record time in this platform.
* All allocated time must reflect an after-the-fact determination of actual activity (not budgeted) of each employee.  
* Each nonexempt and part time employee’s total monthly time allocation must account for employees’ total time. Exempt and full time employees may have time associated with “OWL Operations” that is an overhead charge not linked to a specific client contract, grant, restricted donation, or government award.
* Final time allocations are subject to internal or external auditing.

#### Additional requirements specific to nonexempt employees
For the purposes of this policy, time worked includes all time that a nonexempt employee is required to be performing duties for OWL. Time worked is used to determine overtime pay required for nonexempt employees. All employees are encouraged and expected to take meal and rest breaks, consistent with their responsibilities and applicable law. 

The following provisions are included as time worked:

* Work performed at home or while traveling for work by a nonexempt employee will be counted as time worked, subject to review and approval by the employee’s manager or the COO. 
* Rest periods of 15 minutes or less during the work day are counted as time worked (see more details below).

Per the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), OWL does not count the following provisions as time worked:

* Approved paid absences, including sick leave, vacation leave, holiday leave, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave, military leave, jury and witness duty, funeral/bereavement leave, and voting time off are not counted as time worked. 
* Uninterrupted time off for meals is not counted as time worked (see more details below).

Employees are required to immediately notify the COO or Chair of the Board if they believe they are being pressured or coerced by any manager or other employee to not take any portion of a provided rest break or meal period.

#### Rest breaks
Non-exempt employees who work 3½ or more hours per day are provided one 15-minute duty-free rest break for every four hours or major fraction thereof worked. For purposes of this policy, “major fraction” means any time greater than two hours. So, if you work at least 3½ hours, but no more than six hours in a workday, you are provided one 15-minute rest break. If you work more than six hours, but no more than 10 hours in a workday, you are provided two 15-minute rest breaks: one during the first half of your shift and a second rest break during the second half of your shift. If you work more than 10 hours but no more than 14 hours in a day, you are provided three 15-minute rest breaks.

Rest breaks from your normal work assignments should be taken as close to the middle of each work period as is practical. Non-exempt employees are paid for all rest break periods. Accordingly, you do not need to “clock out” when taking a rest break. Rest periods may not be accumulated or used as a basis for starting work late, leaving work early, or extending a meal period.

#### Meal periods
Non-exempt employees who work more than five hours in a workday are provided an unpaid, off-duty meal period of at least 30 minutes. Non-exempt employees who work no more than six hours per day can waive their right to an unpaid meal period in writing, with the consent of OWL. Non-exempt employees who work more than 10 hours in a day are provided a second unpaid, off-duty 30-minute meal period. However, any employee covered by this policy who works no more than 12 hours can waive their second meal period, but only if the first one was not waived in any manner. Any waiver of the second meal period must be in writing and submitted before the second meal period. Contact your manager if you would like to waive your right to a second meal period, as explained above.

You are responsible for scheduling your own meal period, but it should begin no later than the end of your fifth hour of work. For example, an employee who begins working at 8 a.m. must begin their meal period no later than 1:00 p.m. When scheduling your meal period, you should try to anticipate your workflow and deadlines in order to be completely off work for at least 30 minutes. Employees are prohibited from working “off the clock” during their meal period.

#### Lactation breaks
OWL supports an employee who chooses to breastfeed and will provide reasonable accommodations for this purpose, including reasonable amount of paid break times during the workday to accommodate an employee’s need to express milk for the employee’s infant child each time the employee has need to express. An employee should notify their manager or the COO in cases where they need to request a lactation accommodation beyond what is described in this policy. 

#### Time reporting
All nonexempt employees are responsible for accurately recording the time they begin and end their work, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period. They must also record the beginning and ending time of any split shift or departure from work for personal reasons. Such records must be submitted to the employee’s manager (or the COO) no later than the 15th of the following month.

While OWL does not specify an exact form or program that must be used for timekeeping purposes, it is the employee’s responsibility to validate the accuracy of their time record and to certify this accuracy via actual or electronic signature. The OWL bookkeeper will review the time record before submitting it for payroll processing. In the event of an error in reporting time, employees must immediately report the problem to the COO and bookkeeper. 

Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records or recording time on another employee’s time record may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
