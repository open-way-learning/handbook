# Professional development
Open Way Learning values individual contributions to our shared mission and vision. As the nonprofit continues to attract highly qualified staff members, the long-term reality is that all of these individuals will need to continue to grow and develop so that we all can maintain a satisfied, highly functioning, and productive organization. This policy ensures we do that by:

* Assisting all staff in creating individual professional development plans.  
* Reduce turnover of employees at all levels.  
* Increase productivity and job satisfaction among all members of the organization.  
* Increase staff referrals for open positions.  
* Help ensure all employees are able to fulfill their professional responsibilities and goals.

OWL Managers are the primary mentors for employees seeking professional development opportunities. At each annual review, the manager and employee will work together to fill out an individual professional development plan. The employee is responsible for taking action on his/her behalf, as outlined in the plan. At each review, the plan will be revisited, discussed, and updated as necessary.
