# Economic benefits and insurance

## Retirement plan
All full time employees will be eligible for a 403(b) plan through Newport Group that will allow them to invest in Vanguard EFTs and Mutual Funds. Open Way Learning will make a non elective contribution of 5% of an employee’s salary that will be distributed at every pay period. Employees may elect to contribute up to the maximum limit prescribed by the government (as reference, this was \~$20,500 in 2022\) from their paychecks as a pre-tax and/or Roth contribution as well. Full details of the plan will be provided upon hiring and support will be provided to assist in the enrollment process.

## Health insurance stipend
All full time employees will receive $500/month as a health insurance reimbursement stipend. Employees are encouraged to purchase health insurance through the health insurance marketplace on [`healthcare.gov`](https://www.healthcare.gov/) or through a private insurer. Until the size of the organization merits the purchase of a group plan, this solution is the most advantageous and cost effective. Employees can choose to take this stipend as part of their salary or can use it as a contribution for their 403(b) plan. Note that you will need to notify the OWL Bookkeeper or COO to request your stipend preferences, as the default will be included in your paycheck.

## Other benefits
Open Way Learning participates in the provisions of the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Full and part time employees’ contributions are deducted from each paycheck and Open Way Learning contributes at the applicable wage base as established by federal law. 

All OWL employees (except for directors) are also covered for benefits under the Workersʹ Compensation Law.  Absences for which worker compensation benefits are provided are not charged against the employee.  To assure proper protection for employees and Open Way Learning, report every illness or injury to a manager, regardless of how minor it appears. OWL will advise the employee of the procedure for submitting a workers’ compensation claim. If necessary, injured employees will be referred to a medical care facility. Employees should retain all paperwork provided to them by the medical facility. Failure to report a work-related illness or injury promptly could result in denial of benefits. An employee’s report should contain as many details as possible, including the date, time, description of the illness or injury, and the names of any witnesses.

{% hint style="info" %}
A separate insurance company administers the worker’s compensation insurance. Representatives of this company may contact injured employees regarding their benefits under the plan.

Open Way Learning reserves the right to modify or terminate any employee benefits, at any time.
