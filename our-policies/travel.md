description: Open Way Learning's travel policies
---

The intent of this policy is to help ensure that all business related travel done by Open Way Learning (OWL) employees is fair and equitable to both the traveler and the organization. Note that all independent contractors working on behalf of OWL are strongly encouraged to follow this Travel Policy, but per IRS policy, OWL cannot mandate its compliance. Nevertheless, this policy is provided as reference to independent contractors and (for clarity, herein deemed consultants) so that they have the option of following the same protocols as OWL employees, in lieu of their own, for any OWL-related travel.

This Travel Policy is not intended to cover every possible situation or scenario that may arise. In all matters, travelers are representing OWL and should act in an ethical, practical and fiscally responsible manner. 

From time to time OWL may make changes or updates to this OWL Travel Policy. OWL will communicate such updates to all affected parties and post any such updated versions of this OWL Travel Policy to the OWL Policies & Procedures Google Site. The Chief Operations Officer (COO) has final responsibility for interpretation of the OWL Travel Policy. 

## Travel management and general policies 
To be reimbursable, all expenses incurred must be necessary to the business of the organization and in compliance with IRS, state and/or granting agency regulations and represent a reasonable and appropriate use of funds. Certain additional regulations regarding travel may be required depending upon the funding source of the activities. 

An OWL manager for a specific client project or the COO will authorize each domestic business trip in advance of travel via the issuance of an approved Statement of Work (for employees) and both the Statement of Work and Contractor Scope of Work (for consultants). 

It’s important to note that compensation is handled differently for exempt and non-exempt OWL employees, as well as consultants who provide services for OWL. Exempt OWL employees are compensated on a monthly basis and not on a fee-for-service basis. Non-exempt OWL employees and independent contractors are compensated based on the rates and terms articulated in the applicable Statement of Work and/or Contractor Scope of Work for the service in question. Reimbursements for any travel-related expenses are equally applicable to all employees and consultants, as described in this policy.

When traveling on behalf of OWL, employees and consultants should spend money on reasonable and necessary expenses as if it were their own. 

Upon the issuance of approved documentation as described above, it is the employee's or consultant’s responsibility to make the necessary travel arrangements in a timely manner, ideally 30-45 days from the date of service. Note that depending on the nature of the service and Scope of Work, the OWL Administrative Assistant may book travel arrangements on behalf of OWL employees. 

Employees may accumulate personal reward points, miles, etc. on for work related travel for OWL, however, they are expected to book travel according to the lowest reasonable rate and not for better perks from credit card or vendor loyalty programs, including company credit cards. 

Employees must book travel and accommodations through credible and nationally recognized travel providers (e.g., verified by the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/), Yelp ratings, etc.), with rates and protocols that can be verified as being consistent with generally accepted industry practice. This includes the use of known and reputable air/hotel/car companies whenever possible.

Any exceptions to this Policy that employees need must be approved in writing by the COO prior to arranging travel. Failure to obtain advance approval may result in the refusal of reimbursement of travel expenses. Exception requests must include reference to the approved Statement of Work, screenshots from the travel platform being used (as evidence of the need as relevant), and a detailed reason for the request in the body of the email.

Requests for reimbursement must be made via the Productive.io platform, or in the case of contractors, via an invoice to Open Way Learning that includes the dates of travel, reference to an approved Contractor Scope of Work, the invoice number, and itemized listing of all travel expenses, including electronic copies of all receipts. 

Misuse or violation of the Travel Policy and guidelines may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of the employee or termination of a contract agreement with a Consultant.

## Reimbursable expenses
The following types of expenses, if incurred in compliance with this policy and while on OWL business, may be submitted for reimbursement: 

* Airfare, including taxes and handling fees 
* Per diem amount for meals and accommodations [^per-diem]
* Baggage handling 

Ground transportation: car rental, mileage, gas, public transportation (railroad, bus, business use of personal vehicle taxi/shuttle), tolls and parking (with appropriate receipt) 

As reference, approved federal per diem rates can be found at [`gsa.gov/perdiem`](www.gsa.gov/perdiem) and can be searched by city or county.  If neither of these are listed for your location, the standard rate will be applied. There are also many organizations that choose to have a combination of both per diem and an accountable plan.  

As we’ve seen, choosing the type of plan that is best for your organization can be a complex decision.  A good place to start is to look at the regulations or applicable grant requirements that apply to your organization or the project prior to implementing or making any changes.  It’s always a good idea to discuss proposed changes with your auditor or accounting professional before implementing them. And remember, whether it’s per diem, accountable, or a combination, the most important part is consistent enforcement of your policy.

## Non-reimbursable expenses
The following is a partial listing of items that are typically considered non-reimbursable, or not eligible for direct expense to the OWL travel account: 

* Purchase of liability insurance coverage on car rentals above what is outlined below in the provisions for Ground Transportation. 
* Change Fees for flights and/or hotels when changes are for personal reasons (desire to get home early, desire to stay on-site longer, personal emergencies, etc.) 
* Meals and accommodations beyond what is covered by approved per diem amounts
* Hotel Resort Fees
* Flight upgrades
* Bar expenses (note that alcohol, such as a beer or glass of wine with dinner, may be covered as long as the total meal expense does not exceed per diem amounts. Alcohol is also not a covered expenditure for any contracts that receive federal funding, as well as certain grants)
* Any meals that are provided by the host, such as those offered as part of an attended meeting or conference.  “Double dipping” is not allowed. 
* When lodging accommodations have been arranged by OWL or the host and the individual elects to stay elsewhere. Reimbursement is also not allowed for transportation between the alternate lodging and the meeting site.
* Tips/gratuities outside of per diem amounts.
* Damages to personal/rental vehicles while on business 
* Fines for traffic violations while on business 
* Loss of personal property while on OWL business 
* Dues to airline clubs 
* Laundry and valet services 
* Cost of personal credit cards 
* Purchase of in-room movies and entertainment 
* Health club fees / recreation costs 
* Medical expenses 
* Child care fees 
* Kennel fees 
* Expenses for guests who accompany the employee or consultant when traveling 

## Non-compensable time

Travel time that is not part of an approved service facilitation contract with a client is generally non-compensable and should not be invoiced to the client (or OWL in the case of consultants). Where travel time is included in a contract and noted in an applicable Statement of Work and/or Contractor Scope of Work, the following guidelines should be used:

* Travel to the service location and travel home from the service location is compensated. However, time after arrival at the hotel until you depart for work the next day is not compensable, unless you are performing work-related tasks.
* For air travel, OWL will pay a maximum of 0.5 the daily rate for trips less than 2,000 air miles and 1.0 the daily rate for trips more than 2,000 air miles. For ground travel, OWL will pay a maximum of 0.5 the daily rate for trips less than 200 miles and 1.0 the daily rate for trips more than 200 miles. 
* Non-compensated/non-reimbursed time includes regular meal periods where work is not performed, voluntary attendance at social functions, and time spent sleeping, unless the traveler has primary responsibility for the safety or welfare of students.
* On a service assignment, normal commute time consistent with your normal travel to and from home to work is not compensable and should not be included as travel time. 
* If the employee or consultant finds that all hotels within proximity to a service require a resort fee, they may request a Travel Exception (via email to the COO) prior to booking to ask that the resort fee be reimbursed. 

## Permitted expenses

### Air travel
When booking flights, employees and consultants should endeavor to depart the day before a service begins and return on the same day that the service ends. Extra hotel night stays due to travel scheduling must be approved by the COO before flights are booked. 

Employees and consultants are required to depart and return from their home airport. Requests to book travel to and/or from a different location must be approved by the COO prior to booking. 

Employees and consultants must book the most reasonably priced flight that meets the scheduling requirements of the service, but OWL allows a 20 percent variance on the lowest available fare to avoid unusual demands on the traveler. In some cases, however, compliance with this variance may require the employees or contractor taking an overnight (red eye) flight or making one or more connections. The employee or consultant will use this guideline and will confirm the lowest airfare available on the requested itinerary based on service needs. If an employee or consultant exceeds that cap, the COO must approve of the trip. 

OWL will inform employees and consultants of the need to work through a client’s travel service, if necessary. 

### Hotel
Consultants must book accommodations that are reasonably consistent with per diem rates per the service location. OWL will reimburse employees and consultants  only for the contracted per diem rates, regardless of the actual accommodation rates. OWL will inform employees and consultants if accommodations have already been pre-arranged by OWL or the client. 

Employees and consultants must obtain authorization from the COO prior to booking a hotel if an assignment is less than 50 miles from their home. 

Extra hotel nights are not applicable to general layovers. If a flight is canceled or delayed requiring an overnight stay, OWL will reimburse for reasonable travel expenses related to an extended stay. 

Employees and consultants may choose to stay with friends or family on business travel and will still be eligible for per diem reimbursement. In such cases, a “meal in lieu of accommodation” can be covered by the per diem and should not be listed as a separate reimbursement.

### Ground transportation
Cars should be rented by individuals traveling on OWL business only when other means of transportation are unavailable, more costly, or impractical. Employees and consultants must obtain the most competitive rate available. Prior approval is required from the COO for car rentals that exceed 500 total miles round trip. 

All rentals should be for economy class, unless 3 or more people are traveling together or if an upgrade is provided by the rental company at no cost.

Employees paying for a rental car using a [company AMEX card](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/features-benefits/policies/car-rental-loss-and-damage-insurance-terms.html) receive limited loss and damage coverage for the rental in question. If you use another card and cannot verify that this coverage is included as part of the rental, PLEASE MAX OUT ALL INSURANCE OFFERED BY CAR RENTAL AGENCIES WHEN RENTING CARS FOR WORK TRAVEL. Options for insurance should be researched prior to renting a car and unnecessary optional coverage avoided. It is the responsibility of the employee to verify appropriate insurance coverage requirements and limitations prior to the rental.  

In certain situations that are communicated to the employee in advance, OWL will require that the employee or consultant secure full coverage rental car insurance. In those rare instances, OWL will reimburse for the full amount of the rental car and insurance. 

The employee or consultant will be reimbursed for mileage at the currently published IRS rate when using a personal automobile. Employees and consultants must include documentation of miles traveled. 

OWL will reimburse for tolls and parking charges when the necessary receipts are included with the request. 

Gas should not be purchased through the rental company, as they charge higher than market rates. Employees and consultants should return the rental car with a full tank of gas to avoid unnecessary penalties.

OWL will reimburse the employees and consultants for the cost of a rental vehicle based on the average daily rate from the rental company, at a maximum of $55 per day, before fees and taxes. OWL will also reimburse employees and consultants the cost of the taxes and fees charged by the rental vehicle provider. Employees and consultants must obtain authorization from the COO prior to booking a car if the daily rate exceeds $55 (before taxes and fees). OWL Employees should use OWL’s preferred providers (currently Avis and Enterprise) whenever possible to secure the lowest rate. 

If two or more employees are traveling to the same location, they must share the same ground transportation. 

If an employee or consultant chooses to use a rideshare app in lieu of renting an automobile, they may expense up to the maximum average daily rate of $55 per day over the course of the service, based on actual rides taken. It is expected that employees and consultants will use due diligence to seek the most reasonable rate option in any given area. 

Employees using their personal vehicle on OWL business must carry a policy with at least $100,000 liability and $25,000 personal property coverage for any issues that may arise involving an automobile used in the scope of employment. Contractors are responsible for driving their own vehicles, but must be covered by an auto policy that is part of commercial general liability insurance or a separate commercial auto policy for their contracted work. OWL reserves the right to ask for proof of such coverage before awarding a Contractor Scope of Work. 

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A CONSULTANT IS TRAVELING AS A DRIVER OR PASSENGER IN EITHER HIS OR HER OWN CAR, RENTAL CAR, CARPOOL, HIRED VAN, HIRED BUS OR OTHER VEHICLE FOR HIRE, INCLUDING A TAXI, RIDE SHARE CAR, OR OTHER TRANSPORTATION WHETHER ARRANGED BY THE CONSULTANT OR OWL OR BOTH, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THE CONSULTANT SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD OWL HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIM, LIABILITY, FINE, PENALTY, LOSS, FEES, DAMAGES, AND/OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, AND INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LEGAL FEES AND COSTS ARISING OUT OF DAMAGE, CLAIM, SUIT, NEGLIGENCE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, DEATH, INCIDENTAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OF ANY KIND ASSOCIATED THEREWITH. 

### Per diem (meals and tips)
OWL’s policy for per diem and mileage reimbursement is informed by (but may vary slightly from) the Federal Reimbursement Rate. Employees and consultants will receive a per diem rate for each service day, including travel day(s) where included in the contract (per the applicable Statement of Work), per the current Federal or State per diem rate for the service location. Per diem reimbursement for international travel and travel to Alaska or Hawaii is addressed on a case-by-case basis.

Tips are not reimbursable in addition to the per diem, as incidentals are defined to include fees and tips given to porters, baggage carriers, hotel staff, and staff on ships. 

Employees and consultants are not required to submit receipts in order to claim per diem amounts. However, employees should retain such receipts for internal auditing purposes.

### Internet access
OWL will reimburse employees and consultants for hotel data charges incurred while on OWL business. OWL will not reimburse for data charges incurred while working in airports, internet cafes, airplanes, etc. 

### International travel
When traveling internationally, employees and consultants must have the necessary visa, immunizations, and passports applicable for the location(s) of travel. Employees and consultants must also be aware of any pertinent customs regulations for the applicable destination. 

Depending upon the destination country, employees and consultants may be required to bring a letter of introduction/sponsorship and produce it when moving through immigration control. OWL may assist in procuring these letters, but it is the responsibility of the employee or consultant to secure the letter and keep it on hand. 

For international travel, OWL will reimburse for the same reasonable travel expenses as domestic work. OWL does not reimburse for fees incurred when exchanging money, nor does OWL reimburse for data/voice charges incurred while on an international trip. 

OWL provides and pays for repatriation services for employees, but does not cover fees related to TSA Pre-Check, Clear, or Global Entry.

The COO must approve any travel to a country or a region designated by the US State Department as either a level 3 or 4 risk and/or by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as a level 3 risk.

### Service cancellations
If a client contacts an employee or consultant about a cancellation or rescheduling of a service, the employee or consultant should connect the client to the OWL COO immediately so they can negotiate next steps. 

If OWL notifies employees or consultants that a service has been canceled, the employee or consultant is responsible for canceling all travel-related expenses. OWL will reimburse or cover any cancellation fees incurred for travel, as long as receipts are made available.

If a non-refundable flight is canceled, the credit will remain in the employee or consultant’s account. It is expected that employees and consultants will use this credit on the next possible flight for OWL related services. 

If a service is canceled prior to the employee or consultant's departure, no daily travel rate or per diem is issued. 

If a service is canceled after arrival to the service location (including weather-related cancellations), OWL will adhere to the following guidelines: 

* Daily travel rate and per diem for the travel days involved will be issued (based on the approved Statement of Work and/or Contractor Scope of Work). OWL will reimburse for all reasonable travel expenses incurred in such cases. 
* For all other time associated with the trip in question (e.g. previously scheduled service days), consultants will not receive consultant fees or “additional travel day” compensation for canceled days. 

## Travel safety
In the interest of the safety of our employees and other drivers, OWL employees are prohibited from using cell phones while driving on OWL business, regardless of whether they are driving their personal vehicle or a company vehicle. If an employee's job requires that they keep their cell phone turned on while they are driving, the employee must use a hands-free device and safely pull off the road before conducting such business. Under no circumstances should employees place phone calls while operating a motor vehicle while driving on OWL business.

Employees should always share their travel itinerary with their manager or a colleague before they leave on company business. Include the address and phone number of your accommodations and transportation information, like flight numbers.

It is a best practice to always familiarize yourself with your destination before you leave. Use tools like Google Maps to scout out the area around your destination. Make note of emergency services. If you plan on going out in the evenings, plan your return trip in advance.

If traveling abroad, identify the location of the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate and store their contact information. Consular officers are available for emergency assistance 24/7. You can also register your international trip for free with the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. 

## Company vehicle (applicable to OWL employees only)

Open Way Learning may provide vehicles for business use to allow employees to drive on company-designated business and to reimburse employees for business use of personal vehicles.

When no company vehicles are available, employees may use their personal vehicles for business purposes, as long as doing so meets the requirements of this policy. 

OWL does not allow employees to drive company vehicles until they have been added to the insurance policy for said vehicles. OWL can assign and revoke access to company vehicles at its discretion.

Employees approved to drive on company business are required to inform their manager or the COO of any changes that may affect either their legal or physical ability to drive or their continued insurability. To be eligible for a company vehicle, employees must have a valid driver’s license and a clean driving record for at least two years (A clean driving record means the employee has not been held at fault for a car accident or arrested on charges of violating vehicle and traffic laws). 

Employees are responsible for any driving infractions or fines as a result of their driving.

OWL allows limited personal use of a company vehicle. Personal use includes using the vehicle for personal errands between business activities, to commute between the workplace and home, or using the vehicle outside of business hours when approved on a case-by-case basis. Note that all work safety rules continue to apply when a company vehicle is used for personal purposes.

Because of significant liability to the organization, nonemployees and nonbusiness passengers (i.e., family and friends) are prohibited from driving or riding company vehicles. Employees who operate personal vehicles for company business must do so per the liability insurance requirements included in this policy. 

Employees who drive a vehicle on company business must exercise due diligence to drive safely and to maintain the security of the vehicle and its contents. Company driver responsibilities include, but are not limited to the following:

* Obey traffic laws in your jurisdiction and be courteous toward other drivers.
* Take frequent breaks and not drive when fatigued. This includes avoiding driving late at night or in excess of 8 hours in a single day.
* Monitor gas, tire pressure, and fluid levels.
* Report any damage or problems to the vehicle immediately.
* Report changes to your driver privileges, such as driver’s license suspension, immediately.
* Always lock company cars.
* Maintaining scheduled maintenance appointments.
* Do not smoke in any company vehicle.
* Do not lease, sell, or lend a company vehicle.
* Do not allow unauthorized drivers to use a company vehicle unless required by an emergency.

Employees must report any accident, theft or malicious damage involving a company vehicle to their manager or the COO, regardless of the extent of damage or lack of injuries (the manager or COO will contact the insurance provider). Such reports must be made as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after the incident. Employees are expected to cooperate fully with authorities in the event of an accident. Follow legal guidelines for exchanging information with other drivers and report the accident to local police if required. Do not guarantee a payment or accept responsibility without company authorization.

Employees are not permitted, under any circumstances, to operate a company vehicle, rental car on company business, or a personal vehicle for company business when any physical or mental impairment causes the employee to be unable to drive safely. Additionally, employees shall not operate any company vehicle at any time or operate any personal vehicle while on company business while under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, prescription medications, or any other substance that may affect their ability to drive. These prohibitions include circumstances in which the employee is temporarily unable to operate a vehicle safely or legally because of impairment, illness, medication, or intoxication.
Employees who violate company vehicle rules are subject to disciplinary actions which may include verbal and written warnings, suspension of vehicle privileges, termination and legal action.

## Travel FAQs
Frequently asked questions about travel for Open Way Learning

### How do I book air and hotel travel?
You are free to use any reputable travel platform or app as long as you look for the accepted and reasonably lowest cost options for the travel that’s needed for the service you are to provide. For airfare, this should be the lowest cost option, without having to fly a “redeye” to and from your home airport, unless the airfare is more than 20% of the lowest other option. For accommodations, you are free to select any you wish, knowing that the reimbursement amount will only cover the local per diem rates.

### What are the limits for travel?
Refer to the policy above. Email your manager or the COO if you need to extend travel beyond these limits. Also be sure to make a copy of the approval email to any invoice or reimbursement request. 

### Do I need to keep my receipts?
Yes. You should make every effort to keep every receipt, but receipts are only required for all expenses over $25. If you lose a receipt you should note that in the description field for that expense line item on your reimbursement request. Also note that itemized receipts are considered a best practice, especially for large expenses or for any work that involves external grants or federal funding. In these cases, an explanation of the business purpose should be provided on the receipt, as well as a list of who else was in attendance for meals.

### What expenses does the company pay for?
Airfare, car rental, ground transportation like Uber and Lyft, mileage reimbursement, and daily meal and accommodation per diem. 

### How do meals work?
Unless stated otherwise, all OWL contracts include a per diem allowance. You are free to spend whatever you wish on meals, knowing that reimbursement will be limited only to the contracted per diem. Note that you are not reimbursed in cases where the client provides some or all meals (reimbursement requests must be prorated to reflect what was provided).

### How do I get reimbursed for travel expenses, and is the process different if I have a company credit card?
There are two different processes depending on if you are using a company credit card or your own form of payment (company AMEX cards are provided to some OWL employees). You are not reimbursed for company card expenses, as these are reconciled each month and paid automatically (employees are expected to keep all receipts for auditing and reconciliation purposes). All other travel expenses paid by your personal credit card or cash are eligible for reimbursement per the above policy, either by submitting an invoice (contractors) or by using the OWL Reimbursement Form (see above for details).

### Can I use a company credit card for some expenses but not all?
If you have a company credit card, you are expected to use it for all travel expenses, unless there is a valid reason not to use it. You may not use a company credit card for personal use.

### Can I take advantage of vendor or credit card rewards programs that I accumulate while on company travel?
In general, yes. Employees with a company credit card are free to use the points or airline mileage they accumulate for personal use. The same is true for other rewards programs such as hotel points or rental car rewards. However, the employee must not allow the point accumulation to be the driving motivation for selecting flights, hotels, rental cars, etc. That decision should be strictly based on the lowest reasonable cost to the nonprofit. Likewise, the company AMEX cards generally come with an annual fee that must be offset through rewards or miles earmarked for company travel (e.g. if I have a $300 annual fee for my card, I need to ensure that I use an equivalent amount of miles or points from that card for business travel). Apart from that offset, all remaining mileage and points are free for me to use for personal travel.

### Where do I log the amount of time I spent for a service?
All full and part time OWL employees are expected to track all time spent preparing, facilitating, and doing post-service follow-up via the Productive platform (note that some temporary employees may not have access to this platform and will keep a separate time log that is submitted to their manager on at least a monthly basis). Consultants should keep an [itemized time log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vj9ju-TZZC_zXfiFVuziwU7feTnk3H0rzWPtDzZsoq4/edit?usp=sharing) that will be used as the basis for compensation after the service is completed and per the rates agreed to in the Statement of Work and/or Contractor Scope of Work for that service.

### Do I need to differentiate between service prep, service delivery, and post service deliverables?
This depends on the rate schedule mentioned in the applicable Statement of Work and/or Contractor Scope of Work. In many cases, there is a flat rate in the service contract, although in some cases, rates are different for planning, travel, and on-line service delivery. 

### Do I get reimbursed for my travel time to and from a service?
This also depends on the service contract with the client and will be specified in the applicable Statement of Work and/or Contractor Scope of Work. When travel is included, it is often at a reduced daily or hourly rate.

### What is the expected total number of planning hours for each facilitation hour?
In general, an OWL employee is expected to spend 0.5 days of planning per 1 day of service. This may vary, however, depending on prior service experience, the type of service being provided, etc. Please verify this amount with the OWL project manager if it is not explicitly stated in the applicable Statement of Work.

[^per-diem]: Please note that per diem amounts will vary depending on location and it is your responsibility to know what amount has been specified in each contract so that you can keep total meal and accommodation expenses within those amounts. Also note that the total per diem amount is what is tracked, and not individual expenses. For example, employees may “bank” their spending on one day and then apply that later in a trip (e.g. ordering the dollar menu at McDonalds so that you can enjoy a much nicer meal on another day).
