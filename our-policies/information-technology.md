# Information technology
OWL will provide all full-time employees with the following equipment for the duration of their employment:

* Laptop (PC or Mac, depending on inventory availability)  
* Monitor  
* Mouse  
* Keyboard  
* Cabling & Adapters as necessary

All IT hardware provided to the employee is the property of the organization and should be treated as such. The employee shall be responsible for damage to hardware due to misuse or negligence (i.e. evidence of cracked scenes, devices being dropped, and devices not being regularly cleaned). Tips for responsible use of OWL IT Hardware:

* Laptops are to be used exclusively by the assigned employee, and should not be used by family members, friends, or colleagues.  
* Laptops should be regularly restarted (minimum of once per week).  
* All files owned and managed by the employee should be kept in a reasonably organized manner, and should be synced with the employeeâ€™s Google Drive at all times. Likewise, all OWL related documents should be kept on OWL devices, apps, technology, or the OWL Google Drive.  
* Hardware should be kept clean, using gentle surface detergents, and cleaned on a regular basis to ensure longevity. If stickers are placed on hardware, they must be fully removed by the user before the equipment is returned.  
* OWL discourages employees from keeping personal files, documents, or photos on company hardware, but if necessary, note that devices and their contents are subject to inspection at any time.   
* Full and part time OWL employees should always use their OWL email accounts (`name@openwaylearning.org`) when representing OWL in any formal business matter or when representing their specific role to any external entity.

OWL will provide all full-time employees with the following access to software:

* G-Suite Account (Gmail, Drive & Productivity Tools)  
* Productive (For internal communication and planning)  
* Zoom Video & Phone Account (For Internal & External Communications)  
* Mural (Online Collaboration & Design Sprints)  
* Calendly (Meeting scheduler)

Additional software licenses may be assigned based on organizational role and job duties.

Part-Time OWL employees will be expected to provide and utilize their own devices/hardware, with the following minimum capability requirements:

* Operating System: Mac OS 10.15 or newer, Windows 10  
* Web Browser: Chrome (Recommended), Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.  
* Internet Speed: Speed of 5Mbps/5Mbps upload/download  
* WebCam (For internal meetings and service delivery)

Due to the nature of a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) model, OWL is not generally able to support hardware-related IT requests or issues. Part-Time employees will also be provided with software licenses based on organizational role and job duties.
