# Salary administration
Paychecks are distributed once every month for all employees. Pay for non exempt employees is based on timesheets submitted two weeks prior. Paychecks are issued after 8:00 am (ET) on the last banking day of the month.  If an employee has completed a [Direct Deposit Authorization Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ENzOcOIwBK0bZfylxc1mX52EL-qo6tu/view?usp=sharing), pay is direct-deposited into the account designated on the form. If the form has not been completed, a paper check will be mailed to the address they have on file in their personnel records.

Paychecks are based on work performed for the previous period. Paychecks include salary or wages earned less any mandatory or elected deductions. Mandatory deductions include federal or state withholding tax, as well as other authorized withholdings for insurance and elected deductions. Elected deductions are deductions authorized by the employee, and may include, for example, contributions to applicable benefit plans. Employees should contact their manager or the OWL Leadership Team to obtain the necessary authorization for requesting additional deductions from their paychecks.

Employees must notify their manager if a paycheck appears to be inaccurate or if it has been misplaced. The nonprofit reserves the right to charge a replacement fee for any lost paychecks. Advances on paychecks are not permitted. Also note that the workweek for non exempt compensation purposes begins every Sunday at 12:01 a.m. and concludes the following Saturday at 12:00 midnight.

The OWL Bookkeeper maintains a confidential personnel file on each employee. Employees may review their personnel file upon request. Any change in name, address, telephone number, marital status or number of exemptions claimed by an employee must be reported to your manager immediately.
