# Use of generative artificial intelligence
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have raised a lot of interest—and no small amount of consternation—in education circles since they debuted. Students and educators want to talk about and use these tools. OWL employees may wish to use these tools in producing content for the work they do with teachers, students, and other stakeholders, as well as for internal work products. Nevertheless, we expect that any documents, whether public-facing or internal to OWL, be original works that are significantly edited and altered to ensure the final version is representative of OWL employees and not a bot.

If you do use generative AI to produce your work (creating a document, performing research, preparing slides for a workshop, etc.), please acknowledge this use in the work in question unless the revisions done after generation are so substantial that the issue is moot (a best practice is to verify this conclusion with other OWL employees before the final version is made official).

This policy may evolve over time to reflect changes in technology and industry standards, always guided by our commitment to upholding the integrity and quality of OWL work and content.
