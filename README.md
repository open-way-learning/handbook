# The Open Way Learning Handbook

This is the official organizational handbook for [Open Way Learning](https://www.openwaylearning.org/).

## About
The Open Way Learning Employee Handbook (the “handbook”) has been developed to provide general policies, procedures, and processes about Open Way Learning (OWL) for its employees and, where noted, guidance and contextual information for OWL’s partners and stakeholders.

It is designed to help all personnel who directly or indirectly represent OWL familiarize themselves with important information about the nonprofit’s mission and approach for working with schools, including underlying philosophies, employment practices, and benefits of the organization.

## Why a handbook?
This handbook officially began when Open Way Learning was an organization of one. But as our size and impact footprint continues to grow, we have come to realize that future OWL team members wouldn't have the context of those early days as a startup to help them understand the evolution of the organization’s culture and values that helped form who we are today. This handbook is our way of ensuring that all of the essential information that has been distilled throughout this iterative process from startup to thriving education nonprofit is accessible to everyone on the team, regardless of their role or when they came on board. 

We also readily admit that this handbook is extensive and as such, keeping it relevant will be an important part of everyone's job. It is our attempt at "codifying" who we are, how we communicate, and how we work, both internally and externally.

The underlying assumptions for creating such a comprehensive summary of the OWL culture and character include the following: 

* Reading is asynchronous; you don't have to interrupt someone or wait for them to become available.  
* Talent acquisition and onboarding is easier if people can see what we stand for and how we operate.  
* Retention is better if people know how things work and have a say in making those systems better.  
* Confusion over how things are done is reduced when everyone can find all relevant information spelled out in one location.
* Collaboration is easier if you can read how other parts of the organization work.  
* Discussing changes is easier if you can read what the current process is.  
* Communicating change is easier if you can just point to the difference between an old and new policy, guideline, procedure, or process.  
* Everyone feels empowered if they know that they can contribute to this document by proposing a change through a simple suggestion.

One common concern newcomers to the handbook might express is that the detailed documentation makes it seem like we are a rigid, bureaucratic organization. Not true! We feel that writing down our current process in the handbook has the effect of building collective efficacy of our culture and approach to affect positive change in the education space. It also provides everyone in the organization with a rich set of resources to scrutinize as you become an active contributor to the organization’s future. As a result, this handbook is far from rigid and whether you are a veteran employee or just starting your first week with OWL, you have a vital role and obligation in making it better!

Every attempt has been made to clearly document in this handbook the minimum essential policies, guidelines, procedures, and processes that will help you and your colleagues exercise collective autonomy in your respective roles to further OWL’s mission. That said, it is not possible to document every possible situation or scenario that could potentially arise in the work we do with schools. Just because something is not yet in the handbook does not mean that it is allowed (or not allowed). It’s also obvious that this handbook can be subject to interpretation. We do our best to be as clear and concise as possible to minimize confusion or misinterpretation, but also recognize that we have employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences that may bring different interpretations to what they see. That’s not only okay, but it helps us ensure that we constantly ground ourselves in cultural awareness and responsibility. 

Know that everything we do at Open Way Learning is in perpetual beta mode and subject to change and continuous improvement, including everything in this handbook. Any ideas you might have to make your work, our work, and this handbook better are always welcome. The OWL team will transparently review each suggestion or concern per local context and constraints to determine the best outcome and will then update the handbook accordingly. If you have questions or ideas, please discuss them with your manager or contact the Chief Operations Officer (COO) directly. And as always, when in doubt, please reach out and ask!

## A note on applicability
Finally, some legalease:

> Please know that the policies or guidelines in the handbook are not intended to give rise to contractual rights or obligations that can be construed as a guarantee of employment for any specific period of time or any specific type of work. It is not intended to be a legal document or contract. This Handbook only describes policies as they exist as of the date of distribution, and supersede and replace all previous personnel policies, practices, guidelines, or representations provided to you and any verbal representations which may have been previously made to you by OWL employees. They may also be superseded over time as new policies are developed. If any provision below conflicts with a legal requirement (for example, this may happen when a new law is passed following publication of this Handbook), then OWL will comply with the applicable law.
   
Again, welcome to Open Way Learning! We invite you to develop your talents and capabilities in and for our organization, to realize your full potential, and to help us all get better as we work to shift the paradigm for what education can and should be for every student!
