# Pricing structure
OWL's pricing and cost strategy for all our product and service offerings is ultimately set on a case-by-case basis by the OWL Leadership Team, but with open and candid input from any employee and the client. This radically open process is strategically aligned to our core values and commitment to the principles of open source. Our goal is to have a reputation in the education space as an organization that provides unique and high quality value as opposed to being known as "too expensive."

In addition to being true to the principles of the open source movement, we also are committed to being good stewards of every client’s funding. This is why all of OWL’s standard products and resources are open source and available to anyone for free (per the specific limitations articulated in the applicable Creative Commons license for that document). Our philosophy is that the products are free, but we add the value. As such, we charge for premium features and services that enable the client to quicken the pace of change they desire by amplifying the value that might not be apparent when using OWL’s resources in an independent manner. This approach is at the core of our pricing model and helps us customize the value we can provide to each client, while also remaining viable and competitive in an education space that is saturated with less scrupulous actors (for and nonprofit). 

Providing a great free product (and on occasion offering our services on a pro bono basis) is part of our go to market strategy and helps create new client relationships. Nevertheless, because we have great free products, we can't have one price that applies to all clients for the services we provide (e.g. too high a price is inequitable to schools or districts with limited funding and too low makes it hard to run a sustainable business, even as a nonprofit). Because there is no single "middle ground" that works for every situation, we enter into every contract with the goal of a customized, but fair, win-win arrangement for all involved. 

While it would be much easier to have a standard, “take it or leave it rate” for our services, we prefer to stay top of mind within the education community as an organization dedicated first and foremost to providing the highest value in service to students and those who help them succeed. Everything else is secondary, including finances. We believe this unique approach to pricing ultimately creates the moral and social capital that helps Open Way Learning remain a viable entity now and in the future. In short, happy and loyal clients become advocates of OWL, which brings more clients and strengthens our brand. 

All of the above sets the basis for a pricing philosophy that is aligned with OWL's core values:

* Collaboration: We want to keep the trust of our clients through a pricing approach that supports long-lasting customer relationships.
* Results: We aim to provide clear, measurable value for the services we provide, while doing so at a fair cost.
* Efficiency: Our pricing approach should be transparent and easy to understand by the client.
* Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging: our goal is that OWL is seen to be the best option for a wide variety of educational organizations in different geographic regions and contexts (urban, rural, suburban, private, charter, public, elementary, middle, secondary, etc.).
* Iteration: We encourage the full scope of the OWL Maturity Model to be adopted over the long term - the best way to create a customized and sustainable culture of learner-centered innovation for any learning community.
* Transparency: We are public and explicit about what our pricing is based on.
* Pricing Methodology: We take a value-based pricing approach at OWL. The core of the value-based pricing is to understand the value proposition that our innovations provide to each client’s unique goals, needs, and assets.
