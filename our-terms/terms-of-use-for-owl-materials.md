> Abstracting with credit is permitted, but anyone copying information must abide by the terms and constraints of the copyright protecting all components. For example, reposting any part of a component requires explicit permission of the holder of copyright of that component. Mirroring all or any part of this site requires our permission and the permission of the copyright holder. Where components are in the U.S. public domain this fact is stated. Caution is advised in copying and distributing U.S. public domain works in countries other than the U.S., where different laws may apply.

It is the policy of Open Way Learning to respect the legitimate rights of copyright owners. As such, we expect all users of any part of this or other Open Way Learning resource to comply with U.S. copyright laws. Violators may be subject to termination of authorization to use OWL resources.

In accordance with Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 512 (DMCA), OWL has designated an agent to receive notification of any alleged copyright infringement. If you believe that your copyrighted work is being infringed, please notify our designated agent as specified below. Upon receiving notice of claimed infringement, OWL will follow the procedures required by the DMCA. All claims will be forwarded to the appropriate web content manager within the OWL community.

Please note: This agent has been designated to receive notice of copyright infringement and is not the correct person to answer requests for copyright permission.

## Required notification procedures for copyright owners
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires that all infringement claims must be in writing and must include all of the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
1. Identification of the copyrighted work, including a list and description of the work or works claimed to have been infringed.
1. A description of the allegedly infringing material-including information reasonably sufficient to permit OWL to locate the material.
1. Reasonably sufficient contact information for the complaining party, including mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail.
