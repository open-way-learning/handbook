# Mission and vision

Open Way Learning is a 501(c)3 nonprofit with a singular focus to help schools develop, sustain, and scale cultures of learner-centered innovation that better prepare students for the realities of the 4th Industrial Revolution.

**Our mission is to help schools restore the joy and wonder of learning for every student, especially those historically furthest from opportunity.**&#x20;

**Our vision is that all learners can change their world. Innovative schools empower that change to happen, now!**

The premise behind Open Way Learning’s work is based on three core beliefs:

* Authentic innovation comes not from the traditional, inconsistent application of “buzzword strategies,” but when a learning community first attends to the difficult, but necessary development and the fostering of a school culture that allows continuous improvement and innovation to thrive.
* Cultures of learner-centered innovation will thrive in schools that have the following four characteristics in place: a shared, living mission and vision; an intentional willingness to embrace collective leadership; a deep sense of systemic collaboration across the entire learning community; and the free and open exchange of ideas and resources. These elements then enable an atmosphere of powerful teaching and learning where all students are able to find relevance and meaning in their school experience.
* The talent and skills needed to grow a culture of innovation already exist in any school or district. But rather than being encumbered by the institutionalized inertia of the status quo, schools can leverage these skills and talents through the application of "the open source way" (transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community), thus catalyzing crowdsourced, positive disruption to better prepare students for a rapidly changing world.

Open Way Learning advances these goals by helping schools create the conditions for innovative cultures where every student thrives. This approach is grounded in the design process the emphasizes building empathetic relationships with students; deeply understanding their interests, strengths, and aspirations; and using that knowledge to co-design rigorous, relevant, and engaging learning experiences that they care about. By centering the curriculum around what is relevant to the lives of students, we help educators craft lessons, challenges, activities, and projects that empower students to build academic knowledge and success skills while making a meaningful difference in their world—vs. just “doing school” as it has traditionally been done for far too long.

Our approach helps school teams build collective efficacy around three core principles:

1. **Academic Safety & Belonging**: Rooted in an asset-based approach and deep empathy, we support schools in cultivating environments where every student feels valued, seen, and respected across the school and in every classroom.
2. **Deep Learning Activities**: We help educators implement innovative, learner-centered, experiential strategies. These approaches inspire curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking, connecting academic work to real-world problems that matter to students.
3. **High-Quality Facilitation**: We guide teachers in fostering dynamic, engaging classrooms where students actively collaborate, think deeply, and analyze critically. Through thoughtful facilitation, teachers create spaces where the process of inquiry and problem-solving takes precedence over merely finding the “right answer,” challenging students with tasks that promote reflection and discussion.

Using a Design Thinking framework, we partner with schools and districts to adapt these principles to their unique contexts. Together, we co-design powerful teaching and learning environments that align with proven strategies, including Experiential Learning (e.g. Project-Based Learning, Phenomenon-Based Learning, Place-Based Learning, Problem-Based Learning, etc.), Mastery and Competency-Based Education, STEM/STEAM, integrated makerspaces, Advisory programs, and fostering school-community partnerships through Business Advisory Councils and Profession-Based Learning networks.

We bring this work to life through targeted training, workshops, and coaching; conference presentations; virtual courses; school study visits; blogs and social media; and strategic partnerships with like-minded organizations. At the heart of it all, we are committed to helping educators and students rediscover the joy of learning and the power of education to transform lives and communities.
