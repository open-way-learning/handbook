# Mission and vision

Open Way Learning is a 501(c)3 nonprofit with a singular mission to help schools develop, sustain, and scale cultures of learner-centered innovation that better prepare students for the realities of the 4th Industrial Revolution, especially students historically furthest from opportunity. The premise behind Open Way Learning’s work is based on three core beliefs:&#x20;

* Authentic innovation comes not from the traditional, inconsistent application of “buzzword strategies,” but when a learning community first attends to the difficult, but necessary development and the fostering of a school culture that allows continuous improvement and innovation to thrive.&#x20;
* Cultures of learner-centered innovation will thrive in schools that have the following four characteristics in place: a shared, living mission and vision; an intentional willingness to embrace collective leadership; a deep sense of systemic collaboration across the entire learning community; and the free and open exchange of ideas and resources. These elements then enable an atmosphere of powerful teaching and learning where all students are able to find relevance and meaning in their school experience.&#x20;
* The talent and skills needed to grow a culture of innovation already exist in any school or district. But rather than being encumbered by the institutionalized inertia of the status quo, schools can leverage these skills and talents through the application of “the open source way” (transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community), thus catalyzing crowdsourced, positive disruption to better prepare students for a rapidly changing world.

Open Way Learning advances the above beliefs by advocating for more open, equitable, and innovative teaching and learning strategies that have been proven to work through case studies, research, and other applicable evidence from and for public and independent k-12 schools. We work directly with schools and districts to use a Design Thinking framework to help bring the above beliefs to life in a local context and to then implement learner-centered strategies that include, but are not limited to Experiential Learning (such as Problem, Project, and Place-Based Learning), Mastery and Competency Based Education, STEM & Makerspace design and integration across all curricular areas, building strong relationships through Advisory programs, and blurring the lines between schools and local communities through efforts such as a Business Advisory Council and Profession-Based Learning networks. We do this work through targeted training, workshops, and coaching; presenting at conferences; offering virtual courses; conducting school study visits; blogs and routine writing and the use of social media; and developing strategic partnerships with other for and non-profit organizations that share similar goals.
