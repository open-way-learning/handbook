# History

Who wants to research this technology and bring their findings back to the team? What is needed for us to scale this work to other areas? What data are needed for us to better substantiate this solution?

If you think this is a conversation at a Silicon Valley company, think again. These are example questions that are routinely heard during the Critical Friends meetings at Tri-County Early College High School—bi-weekly meetings, where all teaching staff and administrators gather to collaborate, share ideas, and develop short and long-term actions so that they can better meet the needs of their students. This example is but one of the many cultural aspects of this small, but innovative public school of choice situated in the rural Appalachian Mountains of Western North Carolina. It also is what became the “source code” for what eventually became Open Way Learning.&#x20;

This school you have probably never heard of was modeled after schools you probably have heard of, including High Tech High in San Diego, CA; The University Park Campus School in Worcester, MA; and Manor New Tech High School in Manor, TX. With start-up support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, TCEC opened its doors in 2006 as part of the North Carolina New Schools Project and has a target population of first-generation college-goers, those at-risk of dropping out, and other historically underserved populations.&#x20;

Located on the campus of Tri-County Community College in Murphy, North Carolina, it has also had a motto of “doing school differently” from day one. That motto and the school’s constant focus to look less like a traditional school and more like a high-tech startup led it to embrace proven best practices such as Competency Based Education, Project-Based Learning, Place-Based Service Learning, bi-annual student-led e-portfolio reviews to parent teams, an emphasis on arts-integrated STEM, and be a model school for investing significant time developing solid relationships with students and meeting their social and emotional needs through a formal advisory program. It also amassed an impressive track record on a variety of metrics that lend credibility that demonstrated how its non-traditional approach worked for its students and the community in which it served, especially students who had previously struggled academically or were from historically underserved populations.

A key turning point in the evolution of the school - and one that directly led to the formation of Open Way Learning - was in the 2015-16 year, when TCEC was named as a finalist in the [XQ Superschool Contest](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-09-14-xq-institute-announces-ten-winners-of-super-schools-competition). This highly competitive grant process allowed the school a chance to revisit and refine its mission and vision, refining learner-centered strategies and innovations, and embrace an open source approach to the school’s overall approach to teaching and learning - one rooted in the principles of community, collaboration, adaptation, transparency, and inclusivity. And although the school did not win the XQ prize, the learning community committed to following through with the plan they had developed, implementing innovative strategies such as schoolwide, interdisciplinary, cross-grade level, and community-facing PBL; flexible scheduling for all students; requiring all project teams have a formal expert/mentor from outside the school; and daily advisory time for students to focus on social/emotional learning, post-secondary plans, Genius Hour, and time to reflect and discuss academic goals. From a governance standpoint, TCEC implemented a Business Advisory Council, formalized their classroom rounds, embedded teacher professional development, and became one of \~150 official [Teacher-Powered](https://www.teacherpowered.org/) schools in the U.S.&#x20;

It was this process of codifying these various strategies and rigorously assessing a wide array of data to validate the school’s innovative approach to teaching and learning (and specifically its impact on the target population students mentioned above) that became the kernel of the idea for Open Way Learning. OWL’s co-founders, Ben Owens and Adam Haigler, were deeply involved in leading this work and saw first hand the power of a living mission and vision, a culture of collaboration, collective autonomy, and the open source sharing of ideas and resources. They saw how these core elements, when woven into the DNA of the school, could catalyze student agency and quicker lead times for innovations that ultimately helped them find new pathways for success.&#x20;

These groundbreaking experiences inspired Ben and Adam to write the book, [Open Up Education! How Open Way Learning Can Transform Schools](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Up-Education-Learning-Transform/dp/1475842007/ref=tmm\_pap\_swatch\_0?\_encoding=UTF8\&qid=\&sr=), which distilled many of the principles from the above experience and sought to establish the cultural and systematic ingredients led to the educational excellence they had witnessed firsthand. Fittingly, this process led Ben and Adam to connect with an ecosystem of educators and innovators from around the world in a quest to establish and validate universal truths about how to systematically create innovative, learner-centered cultures through the use of an open source ethos. The book then became the bridge between the crucible of innovation Ben and Adam had lived at TCEC and what was possible if similar approaches were employed at other schools.

Wanting to find ways to replicate and scale this same experience across the education space, Ben left the classroom in 2018 to form [Open Way Learning](https://www.openwaylearning.org/) (originally a for-profit, limited liability company called Open Way PBL, LLC until the nonprofit application was approved in February of 2019). He leveraged his association and experience with organizations and networks such as Hope Street Group, the Gates Foundation, the Center for Teaching Quality, the NC SMT Center, the NC Center for the Advancement of Teaching, the MIT Teaching Systems Lab, and other forward-thinking organizations to build an initial client base of schools and districts primarily in North Carolina and the Southeast region of the US. Adam also left the classroom in 2020 to officially join Open Way Learning as its Chief Operations Officer and was instrumental in helping grow the scope and scale of the organization’s work with schools and districts across the US.&#x20;

They now work with a growing team of passionate educators to help schools everywhere develop learner-centered cultures of innovation, where teachers, students, staff, and stakeholders openly share, collaborate, and create the conditions where every student can be a difference maker for the things they care about. The fact that you are reading this means that you are now part of the team to help make this a reality for more students in more schools!
