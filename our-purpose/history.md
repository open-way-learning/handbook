# History

Open Way Learning (OWL) traces its roots to the learner-centered culture of Tri-County Early College High School (TCEC), a small but innovative public school in the Appalachian Mountains of Western North Carolina. TCEC’s commitment to “doing school differently” inspired a learner-centered, open-source approach to teaching and learning, emphasizing collaboration, community, transparency, and adaptability.

In 2015-16, as a finalist in the XQ Superschool Contest, TCEC refined its vision and implemented transformative strategies like interdisciplinary, community-facing projects, flexible scheduling, and a teacher-powered governance model. These efforts proved the power of an open-source ethos in creating conditions where all students, especially those historically underserved, could thrive.

Inspired by this success, OWL’s co-founders, Ben Owens and Adam Haigler, launched this nonprofit organization to help schools nationwide adopt similar learner-centered cultures of innovation. What began as a bold idea is now a well-established nonprofit, recognized as a credible agent of change in the education space. Today, OWL’s impact extends far beyond its founders, driven by a growing team of passionate educators dedicated to empowering schools to embrace collaboration, creativity, and equity. Together, OWL and its partners are transforming education into a force for meaningful, student-driven change.
