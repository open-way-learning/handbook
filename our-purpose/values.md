# Values

Open Way Learning prides itself in being an [Open Organization](https://theopenorganization.org/definition/open-organization-definition/) that holds the following core values to guide how we work.

### Results through Integrity

We always strive to deliver the highest quality results and outcomes for everyone we work with, but will do so by adhering to the highest ethical and quality standards. We will always stand behind our word, will never cheat or lie to any of our stakeholders or anyone on our team, and will always be fair and honest in every interaction we undertake, adhering to strong moral and mission driven principles in all of our endeavors. We have direct and productive conversations with our colleagues, clients, partners and stakeholders.

### Transparency & Trust

We are open and transparent in all that we do. We assume good intentions as we work to build trusting relationships with every individual and organization we work with, ensuring our methods, services, tools, resources, and processes are clear and obvious to all stakeholders and clients.&#x20;

### Diversity, Inclusion & Equity

We aim to make a significant impact in creating and fostering an environment where everyone can thrive, regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, sexual orientation or identity, education or disability - a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. We actively chose to build and institutionalize a culture that is inclusive and supports all employees equally in the process of achieving their professional goals. We will work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented populations within our community. &#x20;

### Adaptability & Iteration

We proudly operate in a state of perpetual beta, constantly adapting and iterating our work to better meet the needs and goals of those we work for and with. We have a culture of seeking self, peer, and client feedback to measure and improve the impact we are able to make both internally and externally.&#x20;

### Collaboration

We recognize that everyone we work with brings unique skills and assets to the conversation. As such, we work in teams as a default, always seeking to identify, respect, honor, and leverage the expertise of others to ensure our work is of the highest quality and most efficient.&#x20;

### Collective Leadership & Community

We are a mission-driven organization that believes that through shared values, empowerment, and collective autonomy, we are able to build synergy and develop better solutions for those we serve. These values inform the empowered, collective decision-making for those we serve. It is within this distributed leadership atmosphere that everyone is considered a valued contributor to the work and leadership is defined through action, rather than title. This common efficacy and language ensures that the best ideas get implemented and not ignored.&#x20;

### Quality & Efficiency

We pride ourselves in providing highly customized, efficient, and quality services and resources for our clients and partners. We selfishly guard our reputation for having the highest standards of quality and for a willingness to do whatever it takes to meet the needs of a client or partner. We constantly assess ourselves on the level of quality we provide so that we can continually improve.

### Learning & Growth

We are a learning organization that constantly looks to improve what we do and how we do it. We are passionate about innovation and are willing to take informed, calculated risks in order to achieve our mission. We always consider failure as an opportunity to learn and grow and constantly look for ways to grow the capacity of our employees so that they can better serve our clients in pursuit of our mission.
