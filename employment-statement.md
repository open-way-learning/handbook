# Employment statement
Open Way Learning provides each new employee with an electronic copy of this handbook when you join the team and expect that in short order, you will be familiar and follow its content.

We also provide all employees a separate [Code of Conduct and Ethics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1andwhEY4KWl_4leE2MoSfHpXAOc3Nrz4le6gC_NX52M/edit?usp=sharing) document that includes the minimum essential and nonnegotiable items that ensure the highest standards of personal and professional ethics and behavior while associated with Open Way Learning—the things that have regulatory, ethical, and legal ramifications.

Open Way Learning expects each employee to display good judgment, diplomacy, and courtesy in their professional relationships with members of Open Way Learning’s Board of Directors, staff, clients, and the general public.
